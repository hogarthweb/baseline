"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>, <span class=GramE>The</span> Engraver<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In
the eighteenth century, painting, especially portraiture, was popular among the
aristocracy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A popular, sought-after
portrait artist could easily achieve financial security, even wealth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While engravers could also gain steady
employment through commissions, they were often seen as imitators or glorified
copy machines as they frequently “engraved after” a painting; the painting
itself was considered the more “pure” and original art form.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apprenticed to a silversmith, <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>, in addition to being an engraver, was also a
painter; many of his popular engravings series existed first as paintings. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The answer to why <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
would ultimately select engraving as a form of distribution for his art shifts
depending on one’s perspective and level of cynicism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If one believes <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
own accounts, his prints (often produced and sold as cheaply as possible) allow
him to reach as wide an audience as possible and to convey his condemnations of
immorality to all classes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Others see <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> as profit hungry, eagerly embracing and authorizing
debasement of his own work so he could increase his income.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whatever one’s view, it is clear that <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> walked a narrow line in his attempts to keep his
subscribers happy and feeling they received an exclusive and quality product
while also making his message and art available to people regardless of social
class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most biographers attribute his
concern with the poor to his own impoverished childhood punctuated by his
father’s debt problems and stint in a debtor’s prison.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In
<span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> time, engravings were usually produced <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intaglio</i>. </span><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif";mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Intaglio
printmaking is the opposite of the kind of relief printing that had been used
with wood blocks for centuries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead
of cutting away parts of the surface and printing what remains, the engraver
incises the images themselves into a metal plate (usually copper in this
period, later steel) with tools or acids.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In true line engraving, a handled tool (called the burin or graver) is
used to scratch the image onto the plate--literally to shave the metal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In silver and copper engraving, the surface
of the metal was polished so thoroughly that any scratch would be realized in
the printed version.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Deeper scratches
create darker lines.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The prints are
then reproduced using a cylinder press where pressure is applied to an inked
plate to create the picture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif";
mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Other engravers used a similar, but distinct,
technique called etching where the image is more freely “drawn” (or, more
accurately, etched), using needles crafted for that purpose, directly onto the
surface of a plate covered with a protective ground.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plates are then exposed to an acid bath
or “bitten,” and the areas exposed by the needle, when inked, form the
print.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In both of these techniques, the
artist has more freedom to experiment than in relief printing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif";

style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif";mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'> used a combination of these methods where fine, more freeform lines
were etched into the plate with the burin being used to create shading
effects.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Northwestern Library
Special Collections area has assembled an excellent reenactment of the
techniques used by <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> and other engravers of
this time:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>One
interesting feature that the viewer will note in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
prints, and with other examples of line engraving, is that shading is often
achieved with a series of crossed lines.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An example of this effect can be seen in this detail from plate 3 of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i>, where a
clear distinction is made between the heavily cross-hatched darkness of the
background and the relative whiteness of Ann Gill’s dress, pregnant corpse and
even her shoes, perhaps emphasizing her innocence and thus making Tom Nero’s
crime even more brutal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The
series was popular across the social strata, due mainly to <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
willingness to allow cheaper editions of the work to be distributed.<span

notes that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> apparent concern for the poor

earn more cash: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

little over a week went by before Giles King ‘at the Golden Head in <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Each

<p class=MsoBodyText><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> had completed the
paintings for the series in 1743 and hired, as <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span>
reports, three French engravers--G. <span class=SpellE>Scotin</span>, Bernard
Baron and S.F. <span class=SpellE>Ravenet</span>—an act which he later felt
caused an “obscuration” of his reputation as an artist (xxvii).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> claims
that this plate series, in marked contrast to <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
other engravings, was “aimed at the upper middle class and the aristocracy, a

(51).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It warns of the dangers of
aristocratic decadence and blindly ambitious social climbing among the middle
classes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Although the engravings sold well, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
1751 attempt to capitalize on their popularity by selling the original
paintings was a failure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Hogart</span>,
who is often projecting new schemes to promote his business in some
extraordinary manner, having some time ago made 6 pictures of marriage a la
mode (from whence he had printed and published prints and sold very well to a
large subscription) lately has a new scheme proposed in all the news papers to
sell them by a way of drawing lots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Persons
who would buy them <span class=SpellE>shoud</span> write down the <span

leave that written paper for others to make advances still more and more as
they pleased till a certain day and hour; then the drawer to be opened and the
highest bidder to be proprietor of these pictures.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As he thought the public was so very fond of
his works and had <span class=SpellE>showd</span> him often such great forward
ness to pay him very high prices, he <span class=SpellE>puffd</span> this in
news papers for a long time before hand. But alas when the time came to open
this mighty secret he found himself neglected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For instead of 500 or 600 pounds he expected, there was but one person
he had got to bid without any advance the sum of 120 pounds, by which he saw
the <span class=SpellE>publick</span> regard they had for his works.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This so mortified his high spirits and
ambition that it threw him into a rage and <span class=GramE>he</span> <span
class=SpellE>cursd</span> and damned the public and swore that they had all <span
class=SpellE>combind</span> together to oppose him. (<span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>qtd</span></span>. in <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> xxviii)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0in'>One can only assume that his
audience, accustomed to being able to obtain the same message in a cheaper
format, was unwilling to pay a premium for the paintings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Uglow</span> agrees,
commenting that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> popular print series had
“diluted” the concept of the “original, unique canvas as containing all worth,”
ultimately leading to the conclusion that “mass production as not seen as a
slippage, a stigma, but as another legitimate route for an artist to take”
(271).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, while <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
succeeded in making engraving a more acceptable art form, his plan worked too
well, eliminating the market for his original oils.</p>
