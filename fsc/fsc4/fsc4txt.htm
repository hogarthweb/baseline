style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Although <a
href="../fsc3/fsc3small.htm">plate 3</a> is horrific in its graphic depiction 
    of a brutal murder, it is not the most grotesque plate in the series.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That honor is held by the concluding plate, 
    &quot;The Reward of Cruelty &quot; and the <a href="nero.htm">dissection of 
    Tom's body</a>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>.In the ultimate irony, 
    the heartless Tom Nero becomes a victim of sorts as he is brutalized on the 
    anatomists’ table in an act that exceeds even his most scandalous crime.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Commentators, noting the title's judgmental 
    ring, have discussed the suitability of the punishment for one who has inflicted 
    such tortures on others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uglow comments, 
    &quot;This is a moral as well as physical dissection. Tom's cursing tongue 
    has been torn out by its roots; his lusting eyes gouged out; his loveless 
    heart thrown to a <a href="dog.htm">mangy dog</a>. <a href="skulls.htm">Skulls 
    and bones boil</a> over a fire, like a cannibal rite, a visceral pagan sacrifice&quot; 
    (505).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While Shesgreen, too, notes 
    that the &quot;smiling dog takes his revenge on Tom's cruelty to animals by 
    eating his heart,&quot; he also explains that the implications of cannibalism 
    are even stronger in earlier versions of the plate, and further points out 
    the &quot;satire on surgeons...sadistic doctors, oblivious to the grotesqueness 
    of their autopsy delightfully carving up the corpse of Nero&quot; (80).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>This is institutionalized cruelty in the name of science—state sanctioned 
    and mainstreamed<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Importantly, Paulson recognizes that the &quot;assembled 
    surgeons...are enjoying their work as much as Nero enjoyed his in the <a href="../fsc1/dogbutt.htm">first 
    plate</a>&quot; (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Graphic </i>215). further underscoring the 
    fact that Nero and his companions are merely furthering a cycle of cruelty 
    that extends from the streets to the more learned members of society, among 
    figures who should serve as benefactors, even healers, to us all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Moreover, Tom's autopsy would have 
    had special significance for Hogarth's lower-class audience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Paulson notes that they would recognize the 
    &quot;taboos surrounding human dissection. The popular beliefs that reverberate 
    in the plate include the possibility of resuscitation after hanging, the magically 
    therapeutic powers of a malefactor's corpse and the ability of the spirit 
    of the dead to return to the living&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Popular </i>7).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He reminds us that 
    &quot;the notorious Tyburn riots of the years leading up to 1752...were aimed 
    at rescuing the victim's body from dissectors...a kind of class solidarity&quot; 
    (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Popular </i>7).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fiona Haslam comments that “execution, mutilation 
    and dismemberment were terrifying to all believers in the resurrection of 
    the body.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dismemberment was thought 
    to deny the possibility of the resurrection at the Day of Judgment” (263).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Uglow adds that &quot;Hogarth's 'ordinary' viewers might well have 
    been on Tom's side,&quot; and concludes that here,&quot; Hogarth himself is 
    an anatomist, performing an autopsy on a diseased society, a sharp-eyed dissection&quot; 
    (506)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>John Trusler notes that Hogarth insisted the 
    price of the series remain low so that many of the poor could afford it (135).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>While the scene itself is frightening, 
    even more repulsive is the lack of visible emotion in the plate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>The setting is Surgeon’s Hall; the <a href="presiding.htm">President’s 
    chair</a> bears the symbol of the Royal College of Physicians—highlighted 
    by a <a href="macleane.htm">pointing skeleton</a> on <a href="field.htm">either 
    side</a> of the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many commentators have observed the detachment 
    of the onlookers: Peter Quennell cites the “cold scientific brutality of the 
    anatomists” (210), while Haslam notes their “insensitivity and callousness” 
    (263).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More appalling that the apathy 
    of the spectators is the smug satisfaction of the man <a
href="presiding.htm">presiding</a> over the event.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dressed as a magistrate and often identified 
    as St. Bartholomew’s physician John Freke, he sits in absolute judgment over 
    the scene, pointing to the now-empty chest cavity where Tom Nero’s cruel heart 
    once resided.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One might note the seemingly 
    appropriate Old Testament justice being administered to a man who dismembered 
    a pregnant woman and who tormented <a href="../fsc1/dogbutt.htm">dogs</a> 
    and <a href="../fsc2/nero.htm">horses</a> with instruments not unlike what 
    are being employed against him here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Tom's death, however, becomes, less 
    of a fitting punishment and more the scene of excessive display, revealing 
    a society which punishes cruelty with vulgarity and delights in the power 
    to do so. The tract to which <a href="../fsc3/ann.htm">Ann Gill's mutilated 
    hand</a> points in the third plate ultimately reveals a deeper meaning for 
    the series—one that is distinctly opposed to capital punishment by marking 
    the territory as &quot;God's Revenge.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>By usurping that power, the dissectors of the final plate commit the 
    most serious cruelties of all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Entering 
    a realm not meant for humans, the physician acts a final judge, and if the 
    common fear of the inability of the deceased body to be redeemed us a reality, 
    the physician not only has dominion over the body but over the soul as well, 
    usurping God’s power to determine the eternal fate of the criminal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Having dispensed with his immortal 
    soul, the anatomist also achieves the dehumanization of the body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth likens the dissection to the brutality 
    of the cockfight by having the circular form of the central table here achieve 
    a striking similarity, as Derek Jarrett and others have noted, to the cockpit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Jarrett states that Hogarth was critical of this form of activity, 
    as it combined “a love of cruelty and the love of gambling, which, in his 
    opinion, degraded the Englishman’s pleasures into vices” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England 
    </i>175).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Further, he notes the resemblance of the anatomy 
    lecturer to the blind nobleman who is the central figure of a later Hogarth 
    plate “Pit Ticket: The Cockpit” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England</i> 
    176) Shesgreen further strengthens Biblical implications by stating that this 
    work “reflects Leonardo’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last Supper</i>” 
    (80).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As these men make bets and delight 
    in the cocks’ brutality, which often resulted in the dismemberment of one 
    or both of the birds, the doctors in the dissection scene escalate this cruelty 
    by substituting the dismemberment of a man by fellow men as their chosen form 
    of entertainment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth makes a similar 
    comment on a doctor’s ability to animalize his patients in a scene from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Four Times of the Day</i> called “<a
href="../../4xd/4xd4/4xd4small.htm">Night</a>.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>There, a <a href="../../4xd/4xd4/barber.htm">drunken barber-surgeon</a> 
    illegally bleeds his victim while holding his nose in a position that causes 
    him to resemble a pig.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, Hogarth 
    warns his public that medical professionals often do not regard patients as 
    fully human and their ability to butcher them without remorse, even with delight, 
    stems from this perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span

  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Uglow states that Nero's pointing 
    finger &quot;implicates both the people and the 'constitution' that governs 
    them. Crime, disorder and impulse find their mirror image in punishment and 
    law&quot; (506).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This condemnation 
    serves to make the series less a simple drama of &quot;Virtue&quot; and &quot;Vice&quot; 
    and more an unraveling of the complexity of individual action in a society 
    which only serves to perfect the cruelties that it punishes as unlawful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      11, 1751, shortly before Hogarth's prints appeared (February 23). His name 
      must have replaced &quot;GENTL HARRY&quot; as a last-minute change to catch 
      the popular reaction and, tied in with the second plate, to offer another 
      example of cruelty rewarded. Macleane was a highwayman who had been hanged 
      at Tyburn the previous October 3 (1750). He was called &quot;The Gentleman 
      Highwayman,&quot; and was said to be son of an Irish Dean and brother of 
      a Calvinist minister at The Hague; he lived in St. James' Street, across 
      from White's and just down the way from the palace. In 1749 he had robbed 
      Horace Walpole and almost—apparently by accident—killed him (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

      Magazine,</i> 19, 1749, 522). He was handsome, had taken to the road after 
      losing his wife and failing in business, and was much admired by the ladies, 
      being visited by 3,000 people in his cell the day before his execution (see 
      Caulfield, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>4,</i> 87-96). Both of 
      these rogues were more timely than the &quot;GENTN HARRY&quot; of the first 
      state: Henry Simms, known as &quot;Young Gentleman Harry,&quot; was a robber 
      who was hanged June 17, 1747 (see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>London

      had separated from the Barbers in 1745 and were no longer allowed to use 
      the dissecting theater of the Barber-Surgeons' Company, Monkwell Street; 
      and their new theater, close to Newgate Gaol, was not opened until August 
      1751. W. Brockbank and J. Dobson have shown that Hogarth's interior resembles 
      the Cutlerian theater of the <a href="royal.htm">Royal College of Physicians 
      Surgeons' Company</a>, and the dissections were advertised so that the public 
      might come to ponder the wages of sin. <a href="nero.htm">Nero's corpse</a>, 
      with the rope still around his neck, has accordingly been delivered for 
      dissection. His initials &quot;T N&quot; are burnt on his arm. The assembled 
      surgeons, wearing birettas and mortar boards, are enjoying their work as 
      much as Nero enjoyed his in the <a href="../fsc1/fsc1small.htm">first plate</a>. 
      The complete reversal, in which Nero has become himself the victim, is emphasized 
      by the <a href="dog.htm">dog</a> (<a href="../fsc1/dogbutt.htm">cf. Pl. 
      1</a>) who is present, licking his heart. J. Ireland (2, 72 n.) believed 
      that the <a
href="presiding.htm">president</a> resembled Hogarth's friend, John Freke (1688-1756), 
      surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital from 1729 to 1755. </p>
