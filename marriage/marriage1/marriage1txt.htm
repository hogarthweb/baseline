another extended treatment of the consequences of sexual abandon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Certainly, there is an indictment of parents
who marry their children to ill-suited partners for personal gain, but there is
also some condemnation of the young couple in the series.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is, however, the male’s excesses which
receive the harshest condemnation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> first plate, a marriage contract is forged,
although, as Robert Cowley notes, “the betrothed couple looks bored” (34).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a href="earl.htm">Earl’s</a> pose is
affected, as he points dramatically at his all-important family tree, a branch
of which is already broken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a
href="lords.htm">groom</a> stares <span class=GramE>narcissistically</span> at
himself in the mirror [The incomparable Lichtenberg inexplicably calls him “a
sick angora rabbit beside a hot lady hedgehog” (87)], but the <a
href="mirror.htm">reflection</a> we see is not his but that of <a
href="silvertongue.htm"><span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>,</a> the lawyer
who is soon to be his wife’s lover.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some
commentators, including Peter <span class=SpellE>Quennell</span>, believe that
the <a href="ladys.htm">wife</a> and attorney have already consummated their
relationship (172).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, this
reading is problematic as it destroys the young woman’s innocence that is <span
class=GramE>so</span> important to her ultimate status as martyr in the series.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>To
that effect, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> uses many allusions to other art
work in his series to both provide commentary upon the action and, sometimes,
to even warn us (and possibly the characters) of the potential doom that is
lurking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This clever foreshadowing
device appears in this series as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Looming in the background there are paintings, which, according to
Paulson, “show scenes of violence and destruction” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Graphic </i>269) including <a href="pic1.htm">David about to slay
Goliath</a>, <a href="pic2.htm">Judith holding <span class=SpellE>Holofernes</span>'
head</a> and <a href="pic3.htm">St. <span class=GramE>Sebastian being</span>
martyred</a>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Less visible are pictures
of Cain slaying Abel and Prometheus on the rock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is also an image of Medusa shrieking in
<span class=GramE>horror,</span> one of St. Agnes, whose refusal to marry
carries an additional interesting thematic gravity and an overdramatic painting
of the <a href="jupiter.htm">Earl as Jupiter</a> in an appropriately omnipotent
pose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s controlling the action here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The <span
class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> family tree, prominently placed in the
foreground, is broken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The realization
of this suggestion occurs in the final plate with the introduction of the
couple’s <a href="../marriage6/daughter.htm">syphilitic daughter</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The forced union of the two will not secure
the Earl’s hopes of an heir.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> also notes that the “manacled state” of the <a
href="dogs.htm">two dogs</a> is “symbolic of the couple’s condition” (51).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
often uses dogs as an indicator of sexuality and sexual arousal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A <a href="../marriage2/dog.htm">dog appears
alert in the second plate</a> while exposing the cap of lord’s new mistress,
but the canines here seem bored and despondent revealing that the sexual union
of the pair is one based on the contract being signed rather than upon any
natural affection and attraction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Although
the sexual suggestions are mild here in relation to the other plates in the
series, the heavy implications of a sexual threat are important to remark upon,
as is the establishment of the triangles which will become important to the
tale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paulson describes the “triangular
arrangement of people: the Earl, the merchant, and the usurer make one group
and <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>, the groom and the bride another” (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life </i>vol. 1 485).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the placement of this latter
group is significant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lichtenberg
perceptively notes, “On her right sits the man to <span class=SpellE>whome</span>
she is to give her right hand in marriage, and on her left stands another, a
young, virile, matrimonial adviser” (89).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Certainly these associations of <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>
with the left will not escape those familiar with Latin who will notes the
“sinister” acts predicted here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The term
“sinister” has been used by critics, but typically in reference to Plate VI and
the inadequacy of the <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> heir.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Used here, the term adds a heavier sense of
impending danger to the entire series of plates.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Importantly, however, the wife-to-be seems to
be unmoved by the advances of her lawyer, preferring to scowl and play absently
with her wedding ring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Ronald
Paulson notes that the “bawd of The Harlot’s Progress has now become the
parent” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life </i>vol. 1 484), and this
is made evident by the by the presence of the <a href="bed.htm">bed</a>,
alerting the audience to the sexual component of the transaction taking
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In reality, this is hardly
different from the street-walking variety of prostitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a href="dad.htm">girl’s father</a> is
selling her for the promise of prestige. Derek Jarrett states that the Earl is
interested in having his son married in order to recoup debts “incurred in
building the Italianate palace” which can be seen <a href="outside.htm">through
the window</a> (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ingenious </i>127).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The subject, he comments, is “not lust but
vanity” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ingenious </i>128).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our gaze, as Cowley notes, is drawn “out of
the window” (28).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the first hint
that the larger issues will be social ones—ones that will transcend the
picture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      to a <a href="dad.htm">wealthy merchant</a>'s <a href="ladys.htm">daughter</a>. 
      One of the lawyers stands at the <a href="outside.htm">window</a>, marveling, 
      with &quot;A Plan of the <st1:place><st1:placename>New</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> 
      of the Right <span class=SpellE>Honble</span> ...&quot; before him. The 
      Earl is pointing to his own collateral, his family tree, growing out of 
      &quot;William Duke of <st1:state><st1:place>Normandy</st1:place></st1:state>.&quot; 
      The branches bristle with coronets, except for one that is broken off, which 
      represents the consequence of an alliance with a woman of obscure origin. 
      The lean usurer hands the Earl the &quot;Mortgage,&quot; now paid for with 
      the banknotes he has received from the merchant (one for &quot;£1000&quot; 
      shows). More &quot;£1000&quot; banknotes are lying on the table.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Across from the Earl sits the cautious merchant 
      holding the &quot;Marriage <span class=SpellE>Settlemt</span> of the <span
class=SpellE>Rt</span> <span class=SpellE>Honble</span> Lord Viscount <span
class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>.&quot; The chain he wears suggests that he is 
      a Sheriff of London (<span class=SpellE>Rouquet</span>, p. 29).</p>

      The merchant's daughter, looking rather angry, is playing with her engagement 
      ring on her handkerchief and listening to the banter of one of the lawyers, 
      whose name, we learn later, is <a href="silvertongue.htm"><span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span></a>. 
      The Earl's son (he is distinguished throughout the series by the beauty 
      patch under his right ear) is smiling foolishly at his own image in the 
      mirror. And in front of this couple is a pair of <a href="dogs.htm">dogs</a>,

text-autospace:none' align="left">The paintings around the room, besides being 
      by &quot;dark masters,&quot; show scenes of violence and destruction. Most 
      immediately applicable is the ceiling mural of Pharaoh being overwhelmed 
      by the <st1:place>Red Sea</st1:place> (with what for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
      was the added impropriety of an ocean painted on a ceiling). On the wall 
      is <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> burlesque of a French-style portrait of the <a
href="jupiter.htm">Earl with Jupiter's thunderbolt</a> in his right hand, a comet 
      flashing above his head, and wind-gods blowing in the upper left corner; 
      curiously, his robes and his wig fly in opposite directions, and a small 
      cannon is discharging just in front of him. The lion's head on the frame 
      is smiling. The other pictures, of murders and martyrdoms, offer obvious 
      parallels to the situation of the young couple: <a href="pic1.htm">David 
      preparing to cut off Goliath's head</a>; <a href="pic2.htm">Judith holding 
      <span class=SpellE>Holofernes</span>' head</a>; <a href="pic3.htm">St. Sebastian 
      being martyred</a>; Prometheus torn by the vulture; the Slaughter of the 
      Innocents; Cain slaying Abel; and St. Lawrence being grilled. An oval sconce 
      frames Caravaggio's Medusa (Uffizi Gallery), who looks down with fury on 
      the apathetic couple; above the gorgon's head is the ubiquitous coronet. 
      The paintings show the Earl's taste in &quot;dark masters,&quot; his vainglory, 
      and his wastefulness. Everything in the room illustrates the last of these, 
      even the candle for melting sealing wax; a &quot;thief,&quot; an imperfection 
      in the candle wick, causes it to gutter and waste.</p>

richly and heavily furnished drawing-room, two portly gentlemen sitting
opposite each other at a silver-plated table. <span class=GramE>The one
somewhat old and palsied, the other still robust—in sound health, at least.</span>
One is His Grace the <a href="earl.htm">Earl of <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span></a>,
a man of publicly attested blood and safely established <span class=SpellE>honour</span>;
the other <span class=SpellE>honourable</span> merely in money and credit, an <a

that time of the City of London, and so <span class=SpellE>honourable</span> at
least <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pro <span class=SpellE>nunc</span>.</i>
They appear to be occupied either in concluding an agreement or in executing
one they have already concluded; the occasion and the mutual relation of the
parties are something like this. His Grace, though one would hardly believe it
to look at him, is just as bankrupt as he is gouty, and his financial potency
is, if anything, rather less than his physical. In contrast to him, the <span
class=SpellE>honourable</span> gentleman is just as title-seeking as he is
wealthy, and yet in the veins and arteries of his family all is as miserably
middle-class as his coffers are princely. The former, therefore, is prospecting
for the citizen's money to fill an empty, high-titled purse, and the latter for
aristocratic blood with which to infuse his middle-class veins. Since the need
on both sides is urgent, an agreement is speedily reached, and on the following
terms. The Earl will transfer to the merchant's family a portion of his
precious aristocratic blood in the person of his first- born, his Grace the
Lord Viscount <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>. In exchange, that family
will open up its strong boxes to his Lordship, and hand over the daughter and
sole heir to the immense fortune on condition that the above-mentioned Lord
Viscount <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> will perform, execute and
complete in a legal way the inoculation of the aristocratic blood on the said
girl of the merchant's family. All this is here given under seal. For the
purpose of sealing it literally, a lighted candle burns on the table. Some
imagine they notice a so-called “thief” on the candle, which would be an evil
omen for the marriage lines. So much is certain, in any case, the candle is
melting and omens of weakness are no good in matters like these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The group at the little
silver table is well worth a closer examination. The alderman as he sits there
is tense, attentive and preoccupied. His less do not even seem aware that he is
sitting: the shins inclined somewhat beyond the vertical, as if ready for a
jump, the feet parallel, the stout shoes with their coarse Stock Exchange soles
planted as firmly as his credit His Lordship s legs are also firm, if not in a
fix—alas and alack<span class=GramE>!—</span> just like his credit. The right,
though not yet wholly in the grave, is deeply bowed m sackcloth and ashes, and
the left peeps miserably through the lattice of its <span class=SpellE>lazaret</span>.
That the latter looks fairly presentable is merely through the contrast with
its suffering brother.<span

peruses the heading of the marriage contract with a concentration which his

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This type of attentive reading is not learned
in books <span class=GramE>nor from books but only through the enjoyment of
great ideas—in</span> bills of exchange. But perhaps there is in this
attentiveness something more than mere caution <span class=GramE>It</span> may
at least be possible. Think of the beautiful Gothic script of the English
calligraphers, and of the golden words written in that beautiful hand: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Right <span class=SpellE>Honble</span>
Lord Viscount,</i> and foresee in this Viscount the future son-in-law and in
the son-in-law the future Earl, and in the Earl the inevitable Lord in the
House of Lords with all his right and might until the end of the world. Indeed,
if such a prospect could not bewitch the eye of a proud alderman, what in <span
class=GramE>all the</span> world could? He has, no doubt pondered all that
often enough, but he sees it here for the first time written out in such
heraldic magnificence and in morally ineradicable script.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span> Beside him stands, hat under arm, his
old, devoted clerk, desiccated by sixty years of service in his counting-house.
It is he who executes the contract, and hands over to the old Earl in the name
of his master what is known in this house as 'the alderman's daughter'. It is
he who, so to speak, performs the marriage ceremony. It would certainly require
much philosophy to look upon the table where that marriage ceremony is
proceeding without some secret agitation. Bank notes with highly significant
rows of <span class=SpellE>noughts</span>, as if adorned with pearls, are lying
there on heaps of guineas, and similar embroidery is to follow. And yet these
are, as is generally the case with the visible charms on such occasions, only
accessory items. Just in front of the old man lie yet more purses which deserve
special attention, just because one cannot tell how much is in them. However,
the most secret and therefore the most important item in the whole collection
is obviously the document with the title 'Mortgage'. I come to this conclusion
because even the accountant, with good-natured curiosity, seems anxious to
observe the impression which such an unexpected blessing will make upon his
Lordship. For in all probability it is an IOU which the alderman is returning,
and through which a part of his Grace's patrimonial estate had till now been
held in captivity. 'Here, my Lord, take back your estate,' says the old man.
The gift is extensive, and from the manner in which it is offered, there is
something about it which is not quite in the nature of a commercial
transaction. This is also felt very clearly on the part of the aristocracy; the
dowry is grasped immediately and without loss of time so as to send the pack of
commoners quickly back behind their natural frontiers. 'All right!' says the
Earl, 'that is what your girl brings to our house, and this which pulses under
here [pointing to the fifth waistcoat button], my blood, and here [pointing to
the family tree], this cedar of Lebanon, my 700-year-old title, these are what
my first-born son is bringing into your plebeian establishment.' In order to
feel fully the immense excess weight of these words over the deed, we must
consider the oriental pomp which accompanied their pronouncement, and upon
which we should like to comment here only so far as it immediately concerns
this group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The old Earl is seen sitting immediately beneath a
state-and-audience canopy, with an Earl's coronet not actually upon his wig, to
be sure, but on the canopy; garbed in lofty, golden, heraldic <span
class=SpellE>splendour</span>, and as if he were himself a sort of magnificent
coat-of-arms, with two crutches as his shield-bearers. Each crutch is stamped
with the emblem of the coronet. At the present moment he does not need them.
The responsibility for his support has been taken over at the other end by one
of the finest private thrones which gout has ever ascended on a festival day.
The sick credit leg is upheld by <span class=GramE>a stool which even</span>
the most delicate fragility would not disdain to accept as support for temple
or brow, and this stool also bears for its services the golden coronet. Near it
lies William the Conqueror with his coat-of-mail, shield and sword, admiring
the noble fruits of his 700-year-old-tree, on each branch of which hangs the
golden ornament of the coronet. Poor alderman! What is now the jingle of your
temporal purse compared with that magnificence and the trumpet sound of an
ancestral glory almost a thousand years old? That family tree is really no
great comfort to the alderman. With his spectacles on, at least, he should not
come too near it. For if I see aright, the noble <st1:City><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:City>
has with his sword hewn down a branch because that branch bore a coronet which
had married a non-coronet. The little branch with its mildew could not remain
on the tree of aristocratic knowledge which had struck its roots right down
into the entrails of William the Conqueror. That the black zero which we see
falling denotes an <span class=SpellE>unaristocratic</span> zero is almost
certain, but whether a tradesman's daughter or a valet's or a footman's is not
revealed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind the alderman, in quite a charming nook, sit the two
lovers themselves—<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>natura</span>.</i>
It is not altogether easy to describe how they are sitting. That their hearts
are not turned to one another is pretty certain, or else the hearts would have
to be differently situated in them than in other people. To express it by way
of a simile is not easy either, at least not in any of the usual comparisons
used in marriage songs. One could not think here of turtle doves and their
billing and cooing, for instance, for who in all the world would bill and coo
in that position? Perhaps the most fitting simile would be to say that the
bridegroom is sitting beside the bride like a <a href="lords.htm">sick angora
rabbit</a> beside a <a href="ladys.htm">hot lady hedgehog</a>. He with the
light and fire of his eyes already dimmed, and with a bon ton plaster behind
the ear that speaks volumes, takes a pinch of snuff with superfine elegance.
His hardly perceptible smile is a smile of the <span class=GramE>most empty</span>
self-approbation accompanied by extreme indolence of body and soul. What keeps
him going is perhaps a half-jealous attention to a small whisper, to which we
shall ourselves listen anon. He sits—yes, he does—but no matter what with and
whereupon, so much at least is certain—he sits miserably. His feet too, just as
his father's, are eloquent about credit. Even while he sits they raise
themselves upon the toes, probably to diminish as much as possible somewhere in
a higher region the point of contact between seat and sit-upon. His face is
turned towards the <a href="mirror.htm">mirror</a>, but only because the mirror
hangs on the side where his bride is not. With the mirror itself he is not
concerned. All he could see there would be, at the utmost, a little of the
silver embroidery on his magnificent sleeve. For it is a <span class=SpellE>catoptric</span>
impossibility that, as <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
thinks, he could see himself in the mirror or could watch his bride in it. It
gives one quite a queer feeling if one compares this fragile marzipan puppet
with the iron <st1:City><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:City> there whom it
takes for its ancestor. And if the courageous, fiery, ambitious and any- thing
but soft-hearted William with his sword had been here in person the safest
little nook in the room for his Grace, provided he had his jumping legs with
him, would have been near the window.</p>

such a match? Just look at them. If we deduct the trivial item (the only point
on which the two good people are still m agreement) that they both, as one can
see, hate each other like the devil, they most emphatically differ in every
other particular. It is too bad! As for the commercial transaction which is
proceeding at the silver table with purses and family trees, all that is
acceptable but--as to the performance of the contract <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

three-quarters of the purpose of these toys are fulfilled; she, on the other

float above his chair, light as the God of Spring over the silver gossamer of a
mist of dew? The bride on the other hand, is she not sitting there exactly in
the attitude of a 'Boots' who is trying to close the lid of an over-filled
trunk by means of a few rough, final hits with his behind? He sits, or seems to
sit, as if he were afraid of needles on the seat; she just the opposite, as if

appeared in print, and of which we shall have something more to say below, we
learn that his name is <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>. And indeed he
must be whispering something very silvery, since he succeeds in inducing such
attentiveness in that owl as can be inferred from the tension throughout the
length of her neck and back, and all while sharpening his pen. That she
accompanies this attentive- ness, which comes right from the depths of that
spoilt creature, with the coarsest expression of vulgar indignation, is, it
seems to me, an excellent touch of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>; for
here he no longer characterizes the lady, and still less the mere creature of
nature, but human vulgarity, be the fault whose it may. Has the father perhaps
risen from <span class=SpellE>fishmongering</span>? As to the legal collar of
our solicitor, I must draw attention to the fact that he does not wear that
decoration throughout the story, but shortly before its end the Law presents
him with another one, and with great solemnity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>This small scene on the settee contains the seed out of
which our artist with the utmost subtlety develops the whole tale. Here
glimmers the spark which by and by becomes the glow and finally the blaze
through which the whole structure collapses. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>,
therefore, lays particular stress on it and explains what may still be obscure
with a few excellent touches from the inexhaustible treasure-chest of his
symbolic language. On the floor immediately in front of the young lord, the
settee group is mirrored in the history of the two retainers belonging to the
family's hunting establishment. They are a <a href="dogs.htm">hound and a bitch</a>.
The hound, ennobled to some extent by a coronet on its side, is already
somewhat aged, somewhat broken down, and somewhat weary. The bitch, a simple
commoner, but fast and lively, has no inclination to sleep, at least not when <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i> sleeps with whom she is united by the
coarse chain around their necks. The little beast looks round quite greedily
for something, most likely for a solicitor. The black spot on the hound's ear
is not a bon ton plaster. On the wall above the settee <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has placed <span class=GramE>a candelabra</span>. The arms holding the candles
are twined round one another (also a betrothal), but the two candles themselves
bum just as little as the two hearts beneath. Or do the candles point more to
the left wing where the solicitor is in command? This seems to me more likely,
because both are still fresh and unlit, and because the one arm of the
candelabra really comes from the side and against all laws of symmetry entwines
itself with the main arm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Had <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> intended to point to the right wing, then it
probably would have held a burnt down stump. They are not yet burning, but are
quite ready to do so. To light them, only night is needed, which will come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Before the open window stands yet another mourner of the
second Faculty. He seems to be of somewhat higher rank than him of the left
wing, first because he does less, and, secondly, because he really wears upon
his head, the golden fleece of the English <span class=SpellE>Themis</span>. <span
class=GramE>For nobody wears that fur who has not already stowed flesh and fowl
safely in his larder.</span> In his left hand he holds the plan of the old
Earl's new palace, and compares the design with the execution. He works himself
into such a state of admiring astonishment over this that his lower jaw and
nose, which in his face are usually close <span class=SpellE>neighbours</span>,
fall apart, and so do the five fingers of his right hand. If his admiration is
not hypocritical, so much is certain, it is not that of an art connoisseur, but
only that of a lawyer, for the building is abominable. The upper columns do not
meet the lower ones; the column bases are round, fluted blocks; the basement
windows are triangular; beside the main entrance lies a dark coach-house which
admits some doubtful light through a round hole, and has an arched entrance cut
so low that coachmen and carriages, when entering, could not possibly escape
being cut off too. And so it goes on. But to reveal the old gentleman's lack of
taste, his stupidity and mad squandering is not the sole reason why the artist
has raised the window. There is no money there, he wants to tell us: <span
class=GramE>a scaffolding</span> and no workmen, the <a href="outside.htm">building</a>
has come to a standstill; nay, it almost seems as if here and there time had
already started to break off parts of the scaffolding. Those swarms of people
in the courtyard are not workmen, but either idlers from this establishment
(superfluous servants) or the servants of other gentry who have come to look at
the building and poke fun at it, and all this in <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
of the descendant of William the Conqueror. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

address himself to the collection of paintings in the room, he realized that
with the guinea which lies there half covered with dust—the gratuity-box of the
servants —the same had happened to him as to the three match-makers at the
table with the chinking original itself. He had almost forgotten it over all
the other treasures in that picture which are waiting to be discovered. The
oversight was advantageous this time: it contains in itself the best object
lesson, and therefore, at least to the gentle reader, the best excuse.<span

pictures which, apart from their diversity in other respects, are all
terrifying portrayals of temporal misfortunes: war, murder, torture,
inundation, pestilence, famine, cannon and comets everywhere, and all that in a
betrothal chamber. Really! If Henry IV before his betrothal had consulted the
coffee grounds, and the gipsy had shown him such a picture gallery in them, the
famous massacre of St Bartholomew would certainly not have come to pass. Here,
however, nobody seems to notice any bad omen, and so this Blood-marriage takes
its course un-disturbed. We need only look and see. </p>

story of Herod, the September <span class=SpellE>briseur</span> of <st1:City><st1:place>Bethlehem</st1:place></st1:City>,
points to infanticide, and opposite it, Prometheus, the fire-thief, has his
liver gnawed by the vulture of remorse. On the other wall there stretches a
huge <a href="pic1.htm">Goliath</a>, his body on the Eastern and his right leg
on the Western side of a hill, whence the boulder of his head is shortly to
roll down. Underneath it, another head is rolling <span class=GramE>already,</span>
the head of <a href="pic2.htm"><span class=SpellE>Holofernes</span> into the

Thus, there is blood enough here. As to blood, it will in fact be forthcoming,
also some similarities with the stories themselves may be found with some
ingenuity of interpretation, everything in short—except the Saints. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We must ask the reader to give a little attention to the
man whose portrait on the wall there occupies the space of four murder stories.
It is a <a href="jupiter.htm">family hero</a>, and whoever cares to see wind,
storm and thunder without hearing them, should pause before this picture. The
hero in a sort of wig which, despite the many recent advances in meteorology,
would still, and rightly, be regarded as belonging among the thunder clouds, is
in the midst of the turmoil of battle. That he stands at the head of his army
is certain, but where that head is, whether in front or behind or on the side,
has not been clearly indicated by the painter, following the manner of
journalists. With a mien full of self-approval, he surveys the rich harvest of
victory, and is just casting his eye to the side where the most successful
harvester stands. His right hand has, with mercy and compassion, transferred
the lightning to his left, where it plays peacefully with the Brussels lace of
his ruffle. The right rests without weapon on his iron hip. Forty to fifty
yards of drapery flutter around him, and full against the gale which is blowing
on to it from three pairs of inflated cherubs' cheeks. The hero has thus his
own wind. However, part of the external gale seizes the main tail of our hero's
wig, and lifts it fearfully. He stands there inspiring awe, and could even defy
that comet's tail which is hovering above him, considering how nearly related
such omens are. Below, <span class=GramE>a cannon</span> goes off right under
the hero's cloak, almost as if the explosion emanated from his trouser pocket.
His pocket pistols are to the cannon, as his pigtail to the comet tail. How
magnificent! The cannon-ball seems to have been copied by the artist <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ad <span class=SpellE>vivum</span></i> in a <span
class=SpellE>favourable</span> moment. That it appears somewhat small must be
forgiven him because of the speed with which such objects must usually be
observed. Around the whole portrait is a magnificent frame of gilded woodwork,
which is decorated above with a grotesque carving, something between a tiger
and a monkey. The picture on the ceiling is a seascape: Pharaoh with his army
depicted just at the moment when his chariot up there, above the solicitor,
takes to the water. As a counterpart, the Ptolemaic system of the stars on the
carpet seems quite appropriate; considering the topsy-turvy domestic
arrangements. Thus, in a way, the whole betrothal is proceeding at the bottom
of the Red Sea, and something of the sort could really have materialized here
if all that blood represented on the walls had actually flowed, or if it had
started the stream to which the comet's tail points so ominously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Finally, a small calculation: the Earl's coat-of-arms
appears here definitely nine times and probably eleven. Once upon the canopy,
twice on the crutches, once on the stool, once on the alderman's chair, once
above the family Medusa on the candelabra, once above the mirror, once under
the mirror table and once upon the sleeping hound. The two probable ones are:
one hidden by the old Earl's wig, and the other hidden by the hair-bag of the
young Viscount, on the backs of their chairs. Our <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
as commentator forbids us to complete the dozen with a third probable on the
bitch, for we are determined to believe that this lively animal was only a
commoner. On the family tree, the coat-of-arms may well appear a further
fourteen times. Such a thing really looks like omnipresence. </p>

<p>For the benefit of the owners of the original engravings, we should like to
mention that in our reproduction, through our having intentionally omitted to
reverse right and left, everything is now restored to how it stood in the
original painting. The solicitor again sharpens his pen with the right hand;
the hero carries his sword once more on the left side, and the old Earl again
puts his right hand upon his heart. I believe that this translation of the
English engraving back into the primitive good manners of the painting is not
entirely without merit. What man of breeding would, by way of assurance, put
his left hand on his heart? If his intentions are not honest, then, of course,
he cannot expect the world to say in the end that he had meant everything honestly;
but this at least, it seems to me, a man of breeding may ask: that if he
cheats, the world should say that he has cheated with dignity (84-94).<span

</span>many good and some few indifferent men had sat—were two females—the
young, young, blooming, and beautiful, but with an air so conscious of the

impressionable heart.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second was her

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>First,

one accustomed to the influence of the beautiful, would have hesitated, after a
brief study, in assenting to the first impression made. It would have recoiled

undercurrent of petulance—not unusual in the sex—a want of firmness, a
susceptibility to flattery, a desire to awaken admiration, and an amount of self-love,
likely to prove fatal to her best interests, if opportunity should ever bring
her into contact with temptation. </p>

just now. It sounds well, does it not?”</p>

class=GramE>not</span> a line !&quot; and her beautiful head drooped down on
her hand, making her the very ideal of the repressed impatience that smiles at
a cherished grief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>&quot;And who says he has not written?&quot; asked the

chair, and making a rush at her attendant. The other, seeing that what must be
done were &quot;best done quickly,&quot; drew forth a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

her lips, and kissed rapturously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>&quot;Here's your father in such a fume and pucker,&quot;
cried Mistress Taffetas, as the sound of voices and the clatter of footsteps
were heard on the staircase. &quot;The carriage is waiting and the horses are pawing;

class=GramE>if</span> your father's footmen are not as grand as if they were
waiting upon an earl, as very likely they may be afore long.&quot; </p>

text-autospace:none'>&quot;Urn—um—um,&quot; murmured Miss <span class=SpellE>Prue</span>,
who had torn the note open, and was devouring its contents. <span class=GramE>&quot;
Oh</span>, its delightful—all about hearts and darts—and loves and doves; and,
oh! what do I see; that he shall meet me to-day—at—at my lord's house; what
does all this mean—and who is my lord? Canst read me the riddle,
Taffetas?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

murmured Miss <span class=SpellE>Prue</span>, as the last touch was given, and
she descended, rustling as a goddess might be supposed to do, when she alights
on earth, and folds her spreading wings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>A contract of marriage had been going on for some time, it
may be as well to state, this stage of our proceedings; and only the young
people concerned were ignorant of fact that so many were buoying themselves in
their interests. While they are driving to their destination, let us clearly
understand the problem we are to solve with the assistance of the
unapproachable artist.—A Marriage-a-la-Mode! </p>

of war as extravagancies have necessitated, and who sees, in a union with
lighter of some wealthy plebeian, the source from whence the <span
class=SpellE>lordling</span> is to derive the coveted means, and for which he
is willing to barter his title and his name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>No heart, no esteem, no community of feeling, no love, are
requisite to constitute a marriage-a-la-mode—according to the fashion of the

right feeling. It is a matter of barter, <span class=GramE>an involves</span>
nothing of those dread responsibilities in the future, which the prudent Lord
Bacon summed up, under the designation of giving “hostages to fortune.”<span

one, be it understood, involving no great amount of moral infamy, though the
one may lead as lax a life as a Roman pro-consul, and the other have as little

by Sir Mammon Flighty, was rapidly driven through Fleet Street and Temple Bar,
until the vehicle finally stopped before a fine old house westward, and Sir
Mammon and his daughter got out, and being received with a considerable amount
