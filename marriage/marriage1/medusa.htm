    <p><b><font color="#FF8000">Shesgreen:</font></b> On the wall a head of Medusa 
      seems to gaze at the scene in utter horror.</p>
    <p>All the other pictures are scenes of disaster in the form of death or torture; 
      they comment on different aspects of the calamitous marriage and the Earl’s 
      fashionable taste for foreign art of questionable worth (51).</p>
    <p><b><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works:</i></font></b><i> 
      </i>The paintings around the room, besides being by "dark masters," show 
      scenes of violence and destruction. Most immediately applicable is the ceiling 
      mural of Pharaoh being overwhelmed by the Red Sea (with what for Hogarth 
      was the added impropriety of an ocean painted on a ceiling).</p>
    <p>Cain slaying Abel; and St. Lawrence being grilled. An oval sconce frames 
      Caravaggio's Medusa (Uffizi Gallery), who looks down with fury on the apathetic 
      couple; above the gorgon's head is the ubiquitous coronet. The paintings 
      show the Earl's taste in "dark masters," his vainglory, and his wastefulness. 
      Everything in the room illustrates the last of these, even the candle for 
      melting sealing wax; a "thief," an imperfection in the candle wick, causes 
      it to gutter and waste. The David and Goliath, Cain and Abel (Sta. Maria 
      della Salute, Venice), Prometheus (Prado, Madrid), St. Lawrence (Gesuiti, 
      Venice), Destruction of Pharaoh's Host (woodcut by delle Grecche), and perhaps 
      St. Sebastian (SS. Nazaro e Celso, Brecia) are works after Titian (269-270).</p>
    <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Dobson:</font> </b>The pictures on the wall exemplify 
      and satirise the fashion of the time. The largest is a portrait in the French 
      style of one of the earl’s ancestors, who traverses the canvas triumphantly. 
      A cannon exploded below him, a comet is seen above; and in his right hand, 
      nothwithstanding his cuirass and voluminous Queen-Anne peruke, he brandishes 
      the thunderbolt of Jupiter. Judith and Holofernes, St. Sebastian, The Murder 
      of Abel, David and Goliath, the Martyrdom of St. Lawrence, are some of the 
      rest, all of which, it is perhaps needless to note, belong to those “dismal 
      dark subjects, neither entertaining nor ornamental,” against which, we have 
      already heard the painter inveigh. Upon the ceiling, with a nice sense of 
      decorative fitness, is Pharaoh in the Red Sea. From a sconce at the side 
      of Gorgon surveys the proceedings with astonishment. Hogarth has used a 
      similar idea in the Strolling Actresses, where the same mask seems horror-stricken 
      at the airy freedom of the lightly-clad lady who there enacts the parts 
      of Diana (73-74).</p>
    <p><b><font color="#375FFB">Paulson, <i>Life, Art and Times: </i></font></b>The 
      first shows the earl’s quarters with the old masters he collects, pictures 
      of cruelty and compulsion from which his present act of compulsion naturally 
      follows, his portrait of himself as Jupiter furens, and his coronet stamped 
      on everything he owns. . . . Here art has become an integral part of Hogarth’s 
      subject matter: it is here for itself, a comment on itself, and also on 
      its owners and on the actions that go on before it. In no other series is 
      the note so insistent . . . it dominates every room, every plate. The old 
      masters have come to represent the evil that is the subject of their series: 
      not aspiration, but the constriction of old, dead customs and ideals embodied 
      in bad art. Both biblical and classical, this art holds up seduction, rape, 
      compulsion, torture, and murder as the ideal, and the fathers act accordingly 
      and force these stereotypes on their children (vol. 1 488-489). </p>
    <p><b><font color="#800080">Uglow: </font></b>All of the paintings in the 
      first scene, apart from the Earl’s portrait, are of violent biblical deaths 
      and martyrdoms, mostly based on Titian; Prometheus being gnawed by the vulture; 
      Judith and Holofernes, St. Sebastian, David and Goliath, the Slaughter of 
      the Innocents, Cain and Abel, St. Lawrence on his gridiron. This is doubtless 
      how the Earl feels as his creditors descend, but it is a gloomy chorus for 
      a wedding contract (385-386). </p>
    <p><b><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> </b>On the walls hang pictures 
      which, apart from their diversity in other respects, are all terrifying 
      portrayals of temporal misfortunes: war, murder, torture, inundation, pestilence, 
      famine, cannon and comets everywhere, and all that in a betrothal chamber. 
      Really! If Henry IV before his betrothal had consulted the coffee grounds, 
      and the gipsy had shown him such a picture gallery in them, the famous massacre 
      of St Bartholomew would certainly not have come to pass. Here, however, 
      nobody seems to notice any bad omen, and so this Blood-marriage takes its 
      course un-disturbed. We need only look and see. Just above the bridegroom's 
      head, they are racking Saint Laurence on his wedding-bed, the grill. Oh! 
      if only you would give this a thought, poor Lorenzo with your snuff-box 
      down there! On the opposite side, Cain and Abel warn Mr Silvertongue of 
      fratricide. Above the holy Laurence, the story of Herod, the September briseur 
      of Bethlehem, points to infanticide, and opposite it, Prometheus, the fire-thief, 
      has his liver gnawed by the vulture of remorse. On the other wall there 
      stretches a huge Goliath, his body on the Eastern and his right leg on the 
      Western side of a hill, whence the boulder of his head is shortly to roll 
      down. Underneath it, another head is rolling already, the head of Holofernes 
      into the work basket of his faithful Judith; and beside that, poor Saint 
      Sebastien receives the arrows in his breast. Thus, there is blood enough 
      here. As to blood, it will in fact be forthcoming, also some similarities 
      with the stories themselves may be found with some ingenuity of interpretation, 
      everything in short—except the Saints (84-94).</p>
