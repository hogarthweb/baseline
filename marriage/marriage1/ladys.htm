    </b>Now for the bride! Gracious Hymen, what are you doing here? And how was 
    it possible to contemplate such a match? Just look at them. If we deduct the 
    trivial item (the only point on which the two good people are still m agreement) 
    that they both, as one can see, hate each other like the devil, they most 
    emphatically differ in every other particular. It is too bad! As for the commercial 
    transaction which is proceeding at the silver table with purses and family 
    trees, all that is acceptable but--as to the performance of the contract <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    sound, but in an attitude <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>à dos d&#8217;âne,</i> 
    and bent over like a sawing-jack, which even her clothing cannot conceal. 
    His arm, how gently propped up! And the hands how light y poised! <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Antinous 
    and Adonis,</i> if they had ever wanted to take snuff, could not have done 
    it more charmingly. Hers, bent in parallel angles, hang down like lame hooks 
    on an old bag which have lost their eyelets. He dallies with the snuff-box 
    and the snuff and, in this way, at least three-quarters of the purpose of 
    these toys are fulfilled; she, on the other hand, dallies with the wedding-ring, 
    through which she has drawn her fine, soft handkerchief, and which she twirls 
    and flings and will probably&#8212; fling away.</p>  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The wedding ring is to her just a pinch of snuff which she 
    has taken this morning for her honour's sake and which, since it was not to 
    her taste, she will get rid of at the first opportunity. Some people want 
    to find a deeper meaning in the toys of these two lovers. That may be, but 
    there may also be nothing more to them. I, at least, do not wish to put deep 
    meanings into toys. His mien, how sweet! Somewhat languid of course, but gentle; 
    with some traces of debauchery but of good breeding, too But hers! God save 
    and protect everybody from such an ornament on their own shoulders, or on 
    that of their future domestic honour. It would not do even as a figurehead 
    on the family sledge. It would hardly be possible to draw a female creature 
    looking less womanly. Uglier, perhaps, but in so few strokes, hardly more 
    malicious, pig-headed, stubborn and yet sly. Indeed, the contrast in this 
    couple goes very deep; it is not only concerned with head and heart, it extends 
    even to parts which, especially when mankind goes on all fours (which no doubt 
    will happen again in the not-too-distant future), are as distant as possible 
    from head and heart I mean the good people are not even sitting, or sitting 
    down, the one like the other. The bridegroom, does he not float above his 
    chair, light as the God of Spring over the silver gossamer of a mist of dew? 
    The bride on the other hand, is she not sitting there exactly in the attitude 
    of a 'Boots' who is trying to close the lid of an over-filled trunk by means 
    of a few rough, final hits with his behind? He sits, or seems to sit, as if 
    he were afraid of needles on the seat; she just the opposite, as if she noticed 
    in it an emptiness to be filled, and there are such seats in the world (88-89).
