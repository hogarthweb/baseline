style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg: </font></b>In 
    the first Plate we see, in a richly and heavily furnished drawing-room, two 
    portly gentlemen sitting opposite each other at a silver-plated table. <span class=GramE>The 
    one somewhat old and palsied, the other still robust&#8212;in sound health, 
    at least.</span> One is His Grace the <a href="earl.htm">Earl of Squanderfield</a>, 
    a man of publicly attested blood and safely established honour; the other 
    honourable merely in money and credit, an alderman and, to judge from his 
    golden chain, a Sheriff at that time of the City of London, and so honourable 
    at least <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pro nunc.</i> They appear to 
    be occupied either in concluding an agreement or in executing one they have 
    already concluded; the occasion and the mutual relation of the parties are 
    something like this. His Grace, though one would hardly believe it to look 
    at him, is just as bankrupt as he is gouty, and his financial potency is, 
    if anything, rather less than his physical. In contrast to him, the honourable 
    gentleman is just as title-seeking as he is wealthy, and yet in the veins 
    and arteries of his family all is as miserably middle-class as his coffers 
    are princely. The former, therefore, is prospecting for the citizen's money 
    to fill an empty, high-titled purse, and the latter for aristocratic blood 
    with which to infuse his middle-class veins. Since the need on both sides 
    is urgent, an agreement is speedily reached, and on the following terms. The 
    Earl will transfer to the merchant's family a portion of his precious aristocratic 
    blood in the person of his first- born, his Grace the Lord Viscount Squanderfield. 
    In exchange, that family will open up its strong boxes to his Lordship, and 
    hand over the daughter and sole heir to the immense fortune on condition that 
    the above-mentioned Lord Viscount Squanderfield will perform, execute and 
    complete in a legal way the inoculation of the aristocratic blood on the said 
    girl of the merchant's family. All this is here given under seal. For the 
    purpose of sealing it literally, a lighted candle burns on the table. Some 
    imagine they notice a so-called &#8220;thief&#8221; on the candle, which would 
    be an evil omen for the marriage lines. So much is certain, in any case, the 
    candle is melting and omens of weakness are no good in matters like these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The alderman as he sits there is tense, attentive and
preoccupied. His less do not even seem aware that he is sitting: the shins
inclined somewhat beyond the vertical, as if ready for a jump, the feet
parallel, the stout shoes with their coarse Stock Exchange soles planted as
firmly as his credit His Lordship s legs are also firm, if not in a
fix&#8212;alas and alack<span class=GramE>!&#8212;</span> just like his credit.
The right, though not yet wholly in the grave, is deeply bowed m sackcloth and
ashes, and the left peeps miserably through the lattice of its lazaret. That
the latter looks fairly presentable is merely through the contrast with its
suffering brother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The alderman peruses
the heading of the marriage contract with a concentration which his Lordship is
unlikely to have devoted to its contents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This type of attentive reading is not learned in books <span
class=GramE>nor from books but only through the enjoyment of great
ideas&#8212;in</span> bills of exchange. But perhaps there is in this
attentiveness something more than mere caution <span class=GramE>It</span> may
at least be possible. Think of the beautiful Gothic script of the English
calligraphers, and of the golden words written in that beautiful hand: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Right Honble Lord Viscount,</i> and
foresee in this Viscount the future son-in-law and in the son-in-law the future
Earl, and in the Earl the inevitable Lord in the House of Lords with all his
right and might until the end of the world. Indeed, if such a prospect could
not bewitch the eye of a proud alderman, what in <span class=GramE>all the</span>
world could? He has, no doubt pondered all that often enough, but he sees it
here for the first time written out in such heraldic magnificence and in
morally ineradicable script.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>
Beside him stands, hat under arm, his old, devoted clerk, desiccated by sixty
years of service in his counting-house. It is he who executes the contract, and
hands over to the old Earl in the name of his master what is known in this
house as 'the alderman's daughter'. It is he who, so to speak, performs the
marriage ceremony. It would certainly require much philosophy to look upon the
table where that marriage ceremony is proceeding without some secret agitation.
Bank notes with highly significant rows of noughts, as if adorned with pearls,
are lying there on heaps of guineas, and similar embroidery is to follow. And
yet these are, as is generally the case with the visible charms on such
occasions, only accessory items. Just in front of the old man lie yet more
purses which deserve special attention, just because one cannot tell how much
is in them. However, the most secret and therefore the most important item in
the whole collection is obviously the document with the title 'Mortgage'. I
come to this conclusion because even the accountant, with good-natured
curiosity, seems anxious to observe the impression which such an unexpected
blessing will make upon his Lordship. For in all probability it is an IOU which
the alderman is returning, and through which a part of his Grace's patrimonial
estate had till now been held in captivity. 'Here, my Lord, take back your
estate,' says the old man. The gift is extensive, and from the manner in which
it is offered, there is something about it which is not quite in the nature of
a commercial transaction. This is also felt very clearly on the part of the
aristocracy; the dowry is grasped immediately and <span class=GramE>without</span>
loss of time so as to send the pack of commoners quickly back behind their
natural frontiers. 'All right!' says the Earl, 'that is what your girl brings
to our house, and this which pulses under here [pointing to the fifth waistcoat
button], my blood, and here [pointing to the family tree], this cedar of
Lebanon, my 700-year-old title, these are what my first-born son is bringing
into your plebeian establishment.' In order to feel fully the immense excess
weight of these words over the deed, we must consider the oriental pomp which
accompanied their pronouncement, and upon which we should like to comment here
only so far as it immediately concerns this group (84-86). </p>
