    growing out of &quot;William Duke of Normandy.&quot; The branches bristle 
    with coronets, except for one that is broken off, which represents the consequence 
    of an alliance with a woman of obscure origin (269).</p>
  <p>There was a tradition in the eighteenth century that the Earl was based on 
    John Wallop, Baron Wallop of Farleigh Wallop and Viscount Lymington, who had 
    been created Earl of Portsmouth in 1743, and whose pride in his ancestry was 
    well-known (270).</p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#FF0000">Dobson: </font></b>an 
    earl, who, with his gouty foot, swathed in flannels, seems with a superb&#8212;if

    a <a

    his coronet&#8212;reappear in the sore on his son&#8217;s neck and the stamp 
    on all the objects in his possession (42-43).</p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800080">Uglow:</font> 
    </b>The arrogant Earl is as desperate for cash as the merchant for status, 
    having spent all his money on French paintings and grandiose building schemes, 
    like the half-built Palladian mansion <a href="outside.htm">outside his window</a>. 
    He will recoup a lot from this marriage; in front of him notes and coins are 
    piled high and a lean usurer is proffering him the mortgage, now redeemed; 
    in return he offers his lineage, the great scroll of his family tree descending 
    straight from 'William, Duke of Nomandye'. He can afford to lean back grandly 
    in his brocade and fine lace, resting his gouty foot on the coroneted stool 
    (376).<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

    </b>Their fathers compete in arrogance; and, while the old Earl, with crutch 
    and gout-stool, expatiates on his pedigree, the square-toed <a href="dad.htm">merchant</a>, 
    resolutely unimpressed though somewhat hampered by his unaccustomed sword, 
    assumes his spectacles to scrutinise the financial provisions of the marriage 
    settlement (172).</p>
  <p></p>

  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></b>In the first Plate we see, in a richly and 
    heavily furnished drawing-room, two portly gentlemen sitting opposite each 
    other at a silver-plated table. The one somewhat old and palsied, the other 
    still robust&#8212;in sound health, at least. One is His Grace the Earl of 
    Squanderfield, a man of publicly attested blood and safely established honour; 
    the other honourable merely in money and credit, an <a href="dad.htm">alderman</a> 
    and, to judge from his golden chain, a Sheriff at that time of the City of 
    London, and so honourable at least <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pro 
    nunc.</i> They appear to be occupied either in concluding an agreement or 
    in executing one they have already concluded; the occasion and the mutual 
    relation of the parties are something like this. His Grace, though one would 
    hardly believe it to look at him, is just as bankrupt as he is gouty, and 
    his financial potency is, if anything, rather less than his physical. In contrast 
    to him, the honourable gentleman is just as title-seeking as he is wealthy, 
    and yet in the veins and arteries of his family all is as miserably middle-class 
    as his coffers are princely. The former, therefore, is prospecting for the 
    citizen's money to fill an empty, high-titled purse, and the latter for aristocratic 
    blood with which to infuse his middle-class veins. Since the need on both 
    sides is urgent, an agreement is speedily reached, and on the following terms. 
    The Earl will transfer to the merchant's family a portion of his precious 
    aristocratic blood in the person of his first- born, his Grace the Lord Viscount 
    Squanderfield. In exchange, that family will open up its strong boxes to his 
    Lordship, and hand over the daughter and sole heir to the immense fortune 
    on condition that the above-mentioned Lord Viscount Squanderfield will perform, 
    execute and complete in a legal way the inoculation of the aristocratic blood 
    on the said girl of the merchant's family. All this is here given under seal. 
    For the purpose of sealing it literally, a lighted candle burns on the table. 
    Some imagine they notice a so-called &#8220;thief&#8221; on the candle, which 
    would be an evil omen for the marriage lines. So much is certain, in any case, 
    the candle is melting and omens of weakness are no good in matters like these 
    (84-85).</p>

<p>The old Earl is seen sitting immediately beneath a state-and-audience
canopy, with an Earl's coronet not actually upon his wig, to be sure, but on
the canopy; garbed in lofty, golden, heraldic splendour, and as if he were
himself a sort of magnificent coat-of-arms, with two crutches as his
shield-bearers. Each crutch is stamped with the emblem of the coronet. At the
present moment he does not need them. The responsibility for his support has
been taken over at the other end by one of the finest private thrones which
gout has ever ascended on a festival day. The sick credit leg is upheld by a
stool which even the most delicate fragility would not disdain to accept as
support for temple or brow, and this stool also bears for its services the
golden coronet. Near it lies William the Conqueror with his coat-of-mail,
shield and sword, admiring the noble fruits of his 700-year-old-tree, on each
branch of which hangs the golden ornament of the coronet. Poor alderman! What
is now the jingle of your temporal purse compared with that magnificence and
the trumpet sound of an ancestral glory almost a thousand years old? That
family tree is really no great comfort to the alderman. With his spectacles on,
at least, he should not come too near it. For if I see aright, the noble <st1:City><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:City>
has with his sword hewn down a branch because that branch bore a coronet which
had married a non-coronet. The little branch with its mildew could not remain
on the tree of aristocratic knowledge which had struck its roots right down
into the entrails of William the Conqueror. That the black zero which we see
falling denotes an unaristocratic zero is almost certain, but whether a
tradesman's daughter or a valet's or a footman's is not revealed (86-87).<b
