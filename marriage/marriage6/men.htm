    </b>Behind the old gentleman, and apparently garbed in mourning-black, stands 
    a man upon so sturdy a pedestal of calves that it almost seems as if Nature 
    had ordained him for a butcher, and while shaping him had taken into consideration 
    the quarters of oxen which he would have to carry. Nature has, however, made 
    a mistake this time. The man merely became an apothecary, who visited patients, 
    prescribed and dispensed as well, and in the end had the four quarters carried 
    away by others. That he is somebody of this sort can be recognized from the 
    pharmaceutical extinguishing apparatus which sticks out of his pocket, a small 
    squirt and a bottle of julep; the obliging man arrived here, however, only 
    when the building was already burnt to ashes. With his left hand he grips&#8212;and 
    with just such a grip as in former times the terrorist Gassner used to grasp 
    the foul fiend&#8212; a rather loosely hanging State-livery by the collar, 
    evidently in order to drive out of it the poor devil by whom it is possessed 
    ad interim. It really looks as if the conjuring had had some effect, for if 
    I read the face of the exorcised aright, it seems to express, apart from great 
    anguish of heart, some indecision whether to jump out of the top of the coat 
    or to dive down and slip out below; just as the devil did with Gassner. The 
    story is as follows: the poor soul there, as we have already heard, is some 
    kind of servant in this household, a miserable creature who evidently serves 
    for half-wages, but who also has nothing more important to do than to run 
    as quickly as State-livery permits as soon as anybody calls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apporte.</i> 
    This innocent domestic animal has, unfortunately, also fetched-and-carried 
    the poisons which lie on the floor here, side by side, the dying speech and 
    the laudanum. 'See what you have done there, you gallows' bird,' thunders 
    the apothecary, pointing with his right hand at the poisons. 'Who asked you 
    to do that? You deserve to be strung up yourself this very moment, you scoundrel.' 
    With that, he shakes him furiously with his left hand and bestows on him a 
    look which hardly leaves him in any doubt as to what the right hand is going 
    to do the next moment. And the poor sinner who outside on the bridge would 
    not have felt the slightest guilt, now in the claws of terrorism begins to 
    believe, from intimidation, that he really deserves the gallows. Therefore 
    the despair, and the mouth which seems to attempt something like a last dying 
    speech. Is there anything one cannot make the Lord of the Earth and the Inheritor 
    of the Kingdom of Heaven believe if only one can get him properly by the collar 
    and shake apart his store of ideas to suit one's purpose? Then he will do 
    and think and even feel just what is required of him. What a wise provision 
    of Nature! How, otherwise, would it be possible to lead whole millions of 
    such inheritors and guide them where they ought to go? But by this method 
    their mind in the end feels the fist on the collar and its steady force just 
    as little as their body the pressure of the air. Thus, with a sort of rapture, 
    man perceives his name right at the top of Linnaeus's 'Who's Who', and even 
    the monkeys tremendously far below him, without considering that by far the 
    greater part of his species stands, according to a different, but perhaps 
    more rational, system, below the dogs and the millers' donkeys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The contrast between the two individuals is marvellous.
The apothecary's expression, pure, genuine metal, full of bull-like force and
resolution; the servant's like a miserable milksop's; his whole head, though
not badly equipped, exactly like that of a sheep with St Vitus's dance;
trembling, actively determined on nothing, passively open to anything. Oh,
whatever becomes of the poor devil, he will certainly not make an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Orateur du Genre Humaini!</i> The coat of
the one almost like a waistcoat, and even buttoned up, so as not to obstruct
the play of his knees as he walks the streets on his salutary visits; that of
the other much&#8212;oh, much&#8212;too long! A proper locking device for the
fetch-and-carry, especially if the magazine pouches on both sides are well
loaded; a true Spanish mantle. Moreover, the garment of the first sits firmly,
not a cubic inch left vacant; everything is stuffed full; only one more pound
of pudding and the seam will burst or the buttons fly. But the other's coat, oh
gracious goodness&#8212;barely half-inhabited, with space enough and to spare
to accommodate the whole pound of pudding together with the apothecary. There
are certainly no buttons flying off there; they would even slip out of their
buttonholes had they been fastened symmetrically; but they are buttoned up askew,
and the tenth button is really poking out of the ninth buttonhole, and the
eleventh out of the tenth, and so on. The device is not a new one, but if the
poor devil has hit upon it himself, he has really displayed some talent for
mechanics. For now the button side of the coat does not quite match the
buttonhole side, but the former hangs on the latter; it is carried by it. If we
now assume that the pocket on the button side will always be specially well
loaded as a man's usually is, then if, for instance, when fetching bread the
excess weight were only six pounds, the button can as little slip out of its
hole as a nail on the wall out of the loop by which a coat hangs on it, no
matter how wide the loop may be. The apothecary's stout leg pedestals we have already
passed under review. The legs of the servant with the permanent curtsy of
impotence which they are in the act of making, hardly deserve the name of legs
and are altogether not worth mentioning. Thus only a few words more about the
coat. This State- and everyday-livery is really an ancient servants' fief in
that family, which at every change of personnel, at every sloughing, always
reverts to the feudal lord. Now since under this procedure some saving will
obviously be made in the course of time, they have been generous at the start
with the material, and everything is rather strong and in full measure, so that
it could be partly worn and partly dragged along by any man from 4 ft. 6 in.
upwards to a height where he could perhaps let himself be seen for money. That
one man will not be as well fitted as another is of course true, but this also
applies to a certain extent, not only to their garments, but also to
their&#8212;services (143-145). </p>
