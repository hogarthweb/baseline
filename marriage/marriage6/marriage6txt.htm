style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth's final plate in the series, showing
the <a href="daughter.htm">countess's child</a> caressing her dead mother's
face, is one of the truly touching scenes in his work. Her <a href="report.htm">lover</a>
and her husband dead, the countess has poisoned herself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Count has also squandered his fortune,
most notably in the promise of a strong family line.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this plate, the couple’s child, female,
but more importantly, congenitally syphilitic, becomes an important emblem of
waste and despair. This daughter wears a leg brace and a patch—both signs of
her only inheritance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quennell calls the
child &quot;Dead Sea fruit;&quot; (177) her syphilis, not to mention her sex,
determine the end of the Squanderfield line.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jarrett states that there is &quot;a certain divine justice in it all,
that although God might visit the sins of the fathers upon the children at
least there are sins to be visited&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England
</i>206).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The child also redeems the
wife somewhat, as she is certainly the daughter of the Lord, resembling him in
the legs and in the congenital disease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

Countess’s child is significant both because she is a girl (the Squanderfield
name so proudly touted and dearly bought in <a href="../marriage1/mmm1small.htm">Plate
1</a>, has died out, and because she bears the consequences of her father’s
carefree nature in her bowed legs (a brace is visible under her dress) and the
sinister black patch on her cheek. (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Graphic

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Thus, the traditional fear of the
adulterous woman and the indeterminate paternity of her bastard children is
thwarted here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The licentiousness of
the aristocratic father has crumbled the family line and, in a larger message,
the licentiousness of English aristocrats has eaten away at the foundations of
England, has withered its proud familited and has penetrated and corrupted even
the middle classes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>But it is never that easy—the
young Squanderfields are, after all, in Paulson's words, &quot;destined to
become what they are, formed by their parents and their respective
societies&quot; and he notes the couple's comparison to &quot;chained <a
href="../marriage1/dogs.htm">dogs</a> and <a href="../marriage2/saints.htm">martyred
saints</a>&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life </i>vol. 1
484)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus if anyone is explicitly
blamed, it is their parents. The <a href="ring.htm">countess's father</a>, who
was so concerned with achieving social status that he pawned his own daughter,
is here unconcerned with the sad scene, removing the wedding ring from his
child's finger to preserve, at least symbolically, the alliance, as well as to
keep the jewelry out of the hands of the state. <a href="outside.htm">Outside</a>,
the city is crumbling, revealing Hogarth's true culprit in the condemnation of
a society which prizes titles and fortunes above the happiness of its members.
Ronald Paulson comments that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marriage a
la Mode</i> makes more of an indictment of society than &quot;A Harlot's
Progress,&quot; where both the individual and society are condemned, because
&quot;one feels that the two protagonists were destined from the start to
become what they are, formed by their parents and their respective societies” (<i

    dropped at her feet, the <a href="daughter.htm">Countess</a> has drained a

    of the vivacious, yawning, saucily alive woman who smiled over tea and toast. 
    A maid brings her <a href="daughter.htm">child</a> to kiss the mother's corpse, 
    but the patch and the leg irons show that the infant is already riddled with 
    syphilis. Shockingly, the grim comedy of life goes on. The <a href="men.htm">apothecary</a>, 
    stomach pump in his pocket, shakes the dimwitted servant who bought the poison. 
    And even while the doctor is disappearing through the door, the <a

    before his daughter's fingers stiffen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>While the Earl's death is almost 
    Romantic in its extreme poses and intense expressions, the final scene has 
    a horrifying realism. Hogarth put aside the Italianate grandeur mockingly 
    appropriate to the aristocrat and the duel, and turned to the Dutch tradition, 
    where comedy and pathos meet. He closed the circle in the Alderman's house 
    with its view of <a href="outside.htm">London Bridge</a>, balancing the opening 
    scene in the <a href="../marriage1/mmm1small.htm">Earl's house</a>, with its 
    glimpse of the Italianate mansion. The French lavishness of the aristocrat's 
    world is countered by the merchant's bare boards, miserly meal and scrawny 
    <a
href="dog.htm">dog</a>. The price of the contract the two men made was the death 
    of their children, the squandering of fortune and the loss of inheritance 
    - the diseased child will be the last entry on that branching family tree 
    (383-384).</p>

    the arms of the City of London on the window pane (the view of Old London 
    Bridge through the window), the &quot;ALMANACK&quot; on the wall, the books 
    in the cupboard (&quot;Day Book,&quot; &quot;Ledger,&quot; &quot;Rent Book,&quot;

    Pl. 1</a>), there is no carpet, the ceiling is stained and dirty, the walls 
    bare, and the ledgers are turned with their backs to the wall to save wear 
    and tear. As J. Ireland points out (2, 53), &quot;The scantiness of his own 
    table is well contrasted by the plenty exhibited in the picture&quot; on the 
    wall. The gown hanging on the wall near the clock shows that the merchant 
    is an alderman. His sleek appearance, contrasted with the meager fare he serves, 
    implies that he spends much of his time at the famous City feasts. The clock's 
    face is reversed in the print; it should read 1:55. </p>

The nobleman in his blood, the murderer in his shift escaping into the winter
night, and his aider and abetter similarly attired, in the grip of her
conscience. The punishment so far was light. Here in this picture it grows to a
terrific intensity for both of them, to the highest pitch it can attain,
judicially and non-judicially, this side of the grave. </p>

blood, in the East End from whence she came, in her father's vaults, not far
from London Bridge, which with its buildings is seen here from the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Here now, removed for ever from the magic of the heavenly
music of the Court and the tumult of Lady Townley's and Lady Heathen's Drums
.and Lady Hairbrain's Rout, she had had the opportunity of making an
acquaintance which might have been of infinite advantage to her had it come in
better times—that is, with her own self. But it was much too late? Announced by
a peal of thunder from her conscience, she appears to herself now for the first
time. What a sight! Rejected in the West End by everybody for whose sake she
had rejected many another in the motherly East End, and now herself rejected by
these same rejected ones, without visits and even without visiting cards,
without rank and, finally, without honour she is now the mockery and the
derision, the talk and the news, of the first city in the world. Ever more
clearly, she recognizes herself at last as the murderess other husband; though
not legally hangable, yet extra-judicially condemned to hang herself, towards
which end one might, in solitude and ineradicable shame, make very rapid
progress. 'Struth! Thus to await the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coup
de grâce</i> from one's own hand is infinitely more painful than the rope which
the law, by God's grace, ordains inevitably for the criminal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Meanwhile, a feeble ray of hope still shone into her
prison. Silvertongue, though arrested and imprisoned, was still alive then, and
knew the wrong as well as the right side of the law; what more does such a bird
need in order to escape from any cage, by the power of the beak, or the gab?
Thus, there was still the possibility that these two gallows-birds, even if not
in the East or West End of the city, at least in some corner of the earth, east
or west, might build their little nest once more. Soon after, however,
Silvertongue is brought to trial, is found guilty and condemned to death by
hanging. It was a very great step to take all at once on the path lawful;
suddenly one had reached the final stage. The unadorned wooden portal with its
entrapping noose through which the way led was close at hand. She still
comforted herself: 'It's impossible—he cannot be hanged—he was too dear to me!
Surely my departed husband was more to blame. Always drunk, always with his
plasters and his pills! He should have looked after me better. Not to steal
when some lovely object lies about in the street is not in human nature, any
more than it is in human nature to let oneself be stabbed to death for nothing,
if one carries a sword. And these, after all, were the only crimes of my Silvertongue.
Oh! yes, there is justice in England, but there is mercy too. This, this is
what I seek; this is my comfort; justice, but mercy too. Oh! certainly mercy.
My Silvertongue lives and will live.' With dreams like these she was still
deceiving herself this very morning when suddenly an event occurred with the
most terrible effect upon the dreamer. It was nothing less than the
thunder-clap: 'No, your Silvertongue will not live, and does not live any
longer. This morning, at the stroke often, he was left hanging in the portal's
noose; you can see him swinging there still, if you like.' That event we shall
now report to our readers in simple prose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>This morning, as the lady might have known very well from
the <a href="report.htm">newspaper</a> even if she had not heard it elsewhere,
was the day appointed for the execution of her lover. Not being familiar with
the fine points of the law, she thought she could easily remember similar, or
at least apparently similar, cases, where a comparable crime had been punished
merely by imprisonment or transportation. Upon this she based her not
altogether impossible hopes, which love and wishful thinking raised now as if
by magic power, to certainty. Thus, to make that certainty doubly sure and with
the utmost despatch, she sends a sort of Boots (the thing over there by the
table that has concealed itself in a man's coat) to the place of execution.
That poor devil now brings, perhaps without knowing just what he has brought,
not only the news that Silvertongue has just exchanged the temporal for the
eternal, and the legal collar of cambric for the hempen one, but in addition a
forget-me-not leaflet which we see there on the floor, lying beside an empty
medicine bottle. This document, whose seal nobody would easily mistake if he
has some human feelings, contains nothing less than Silvertongue's swan-song
from beneath the gallows his gallows sermon. This was too much for a tender
heart. Her husband- that could have been endured, but her lover! Quick as
lightning she grasps a two-ounce bottle of laudanum, which she had evidently
prescribed for herself m the first wild moments other newly-gained
self-knowledge but found somewhat too powerful when it arrived—and drains it to
the last drop. At lunch, the action of the poison becomes apparent; she falls
back- wards with her chair; they pick her up, carry her to the armchair, call
the doctor, call the apothecary, and a good proportion of his drugs; all arrive
but it was too late; had Silvertongue himself been alive and, in a flash'
appeared with a ball ticket, he could not have restored her. That it is too
late may also be seen from the fact that the doctor is warily with- drawing to
pay his respects to the departing soul before the front door This is a brief
sketch of the scene which we shall now describe in more detail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>She dies in an armchair with the insignia of the disaster
which has befallen her, poison bottle and gallows, at her feel—and thus
Squanderfield is at length avenged. An old housekeeper, whom Nature had painted
greyer than grey probably twenty years ago already, holds towards the doomed
woman <a href="daughter.htm">the child</a> whose rattle we have seen before,
hanging from a chair of a different type. This picture of despair puts its
small rickety arms round her neck, and kisses the pallid cheek of the human
form that was called mother, but who has never been much more of a mother than
she is now, when feeling has left her for ever. On its cheek the poor creature
already carries the seal of Squanderfield's blood, and delicate and light
though the little body is, she already needs, as we can clearly see, laced
boots with steel supports, to prevent the emaciated little legs from bending
under their paper-light load. Throughout this scene, which could hardly be more
movingly conceived, the <a href="ring.htm">old father</a> remains as calm as if
the whole daughter had been insured, apart from her rings, which latter,
therefore, he takes care to salvage personally. The philosophical composure of
that man is really incredible. If our readers will take the trouble to cover
the left side of this stoic with a piece of paper so that its edge passes down
his right cheek and the extreme tip of the thumb of his right hand, then in
describing his movement they will find themselves at a loss to say immediately
whether he is filling a fresh pipe, or cleaning out an old one in order to fill
it. He receives this secondary punishment from Heaven as he probably received
the primary also—with as much composure as if it were merely a bill of lading.
What a granite-like imperturbability in that figure there, from the broad,
cautious brow, which seems strong enough to resist a hatchet, to the two Stock
Exchange flagstone-rammers which, in their sturdiness, seem to put in the shade
even the timbered double footgear of the chair in which his daughter dies! And
all that close to the corpse of his only child, and having taken her cold hand
in his, not in order to press it once more, but to prevent her perhaps from
bestowing unawares a ring on the woman who is to lay her out. Surely not even
an elephant or a poodle would do such a thing; it could only be the work of
all-embracing avarice. The interpreter of this Plate has often found confirmed
in real life what Hogarth is trying to teach here: namely, that a certain
collector mentality, better a sort of hamster instinct, intent upon saving
every year certain 'little round sums' as these people modestly like to call
them, by and by overcasts the heart of man with a good, strong callus, which protects
it as surely from all moral warmth as soft swansdown protects the chest from
physical cold; nay, finally invests its owner with the enviable faculty of
bearing every misfortune of his fellow-men, as Swift puts it, with Christian
composure. Incidentally, one notices, especially if one has a cold, how
carefully that sort of person, or whatever it is, knows how to combine his
Horatian aes triplex circa pectus with the homespun <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>pannus triplicus circa stomachum.</i> He wears three coats; for in
those happy days a coat and a waistcoat still stood <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>al pari,</i> just like stocks and shares. One can see the man gives
nothing away, neither money, nor affection for his fellow-beings, nor animal
warmth; of all this he saves as much as possible. The chain under the girl's cold
hand is not one of his daughter's bracelets, but the golden chain of office
which the old man wears in the house, evidently so as not to leave it with the
coat in the counting-house quite by itself, for obvious reasons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind the old gentleman, and apparently garbed in
mourning-black, stands a man upon so sturdy a pedestal of calves that it almost
seems as if Nature had ordained him for a butcher, and while shaping him had
taken into consideration the quarters of oxen which he would have to carry.
Nature has, however, made a mistake this time. The man merely became an
apothecary, who visited patients, prescribed and dispensed as well, and in the
end had the four quarters carried away by others. That he is somebody of this
sort can be recognized from the pharmaceutical extinguishing apparatus which
sticks out of his pocket, a small squirt and a bottle of julep; the obliging
man arrived here, however, only when the building was already burnt to ashes.
With his left hand he grips—and with just such a grip as in former times the
terrorist Gassner used to grasp the foul fiend— a rather loosely hanging
State-livery by the collar, evidently in order to drive out of it the poor
devil by whom it is possessed ad interim. It really looks as if the conjuring
had had some effect, for if I read the face of the exorcised aright, it seems
to express, apart from great anguish of heart, some indecision whether to jump
out of the top of the coat or to dive down and slip out below; just as the devil
did with Gassner. The story is as follows: the poor soul there, as we have
already heard, is some kind of servant in this household, a miserable creature
who evidently serves for half-wages, but who also has nothing more important to
do than to run as quickly as State-livery permits as soon as anybody calls <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apporte.</i> This innocent domestic animal
has, unfortunately, also fetched-and-carried the poisons which lie on the floor
here, side by side, the dying speech and the laudanum. 'See what you have done
there, you gallows' bird,' thunders the apothecary, pointing with his right
hand at the poisons. 'Who asked you to do that? You deserve to be strung up
yourself this very moment, you scoundrel.' With that, he shakes him furiously
with his left hand and bestows on him a look which hardly leaves him in any
doubt as to what the right hand is going to do the next moment. And the poor
sinner who outside on the bridge would not have felt the slightest guilt, now
in the claws of terrorism begins to believe, from intimidation, that he really
deserves the gallows. Therefore the despair, and the mouth which seems to
attempt something like a last dying speech. Is there anything one cannot make
the Lord of the Earth and the Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven believe if
only one can get him properly by the collar and shake apart his store of ideas
to suit one's purpose? Then he will do and think and even feel just what is
required of him. What a wise provision of Nature! How, otherwise, would it be
possible to lead whole millions of such inheritors and guide them where they
ought to go? But by this method their mind in the end feels the fist on the
collar and its steady force just as little as their body the pressure of the
air. Thus, with a sort of rapture, man perceives his name right at the top of
Linnaeus's 'Who's Who', and even the monkeys tremendously far below him,
without considering that by far the greater part of his species stands,
according to a different, but perhaps more rational, system, below the dogs and
the millers' donkeys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The contrast between the two individuals is marvellous.
The <a href="men.htm">apothecary's expression, pure, genuine metal, full of
bull-like force and resolution; the servant's like a miserable milksop's</a>;
his whole head, though not badly equipped, exactly like that of a sheep with St
Vitus's dance; trembling, actively determined on nothing, passively open to
anything. Oh, whatever becomes of the poor devil, he will certainly not make an
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Orateur du Genre Humaini!</i> The coat of
the one almost like a waistcoat, and even buttoned up, so as not to obstruct
the play of his knees as he walks the streets on his salutary visits; that of
the other much—oh, much—too long! A proper locking device for the
fetch-and-carry, especially if the magazine pouches on both sides are well
loaded; a true Spanish mantle. Moreover, the garment of the first sits firmly,
not a cubic inch left vacant; everything is stuffed full; only one more pound
of pudding and the seam will burst or the buttons fly. But the other's coat, oh
gracious goodness—barely half-inhabited, with space enough and to spare to
accommodate the whole pound of pudding together with the apothecary. There are
certainly no buttons flying off there; they would even slip out of their
buttonholes had they been fastened symmetrically; but they are buttoned up
askew, and the tenth button is really poking out of the ninth buttonhole, and
the eleventh out of the tenth, and so on. The device is not a new one, but if
the poor devil has hit upon it himself, he has really displayed some talent for
mechanics. For now the button side of the coat does not quite match the
buttonhole side, but the former hangs on the latter; it is carried by it. If we
now assume that the pocket on the button side will always be specially well
loaded as a man's usually is, then if, for instance, when fetching bread the
excess weight were only six pounds, the button can as little slip out of its
hole as a nail on the wall out of the loop by which a coat hangs on it, no
matter how wide the loop may be. The apothecary's stout leg pedestals we have
already passed under review. The legs of the servant with the permanent curtsy
of impotence which they are in the act of making, hardly deserve the name of
legs and are altogether not worth mentioning. Thus only a few words more about
the coat. This State- and everyday-livery is really an ancient servants' fief
in that family, which at every change of personnel, at every sloughing, always
reverts to the feudal lord. Now since under this procedure some saving will
obviously be made in the course of time, they have been generous at the start
with the material, and everything is rather strong and in full measure, so that
it could be partly worn and partly dragged along by any man from 4 ft. 6 in.
upwards to a height where he could perhaps let himself be seen for money. That
one man will not be as well fitted as another is of course true, but this also
applies to a certain extent, not only to their garments, but also to
their—services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Before we turn to a closer examination of the room and its
appointments we cannot let the doctor in the doorway there get away without a
few more farewell lines, little though they may benefit him. There is some-
thing comic about this figure which can be more easily felt than
described.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Few have looked upon the
retreat of the doctor without a smile, but wherein the ridiculous part really
consisted, they could not explain to themselves. It is true that the broad
knot-wig, the sword hilt in the coat slit, and the Spanish cane with its golden
knob, held somewhat below its centre of gravity and gently raised in meditation
towards his mouth, have a solemn but incongruous air. But is that all? Not
quite. It seems to me that the man's appearance obviously suggests the idea of
belated arrival, or the so-called race against time, a situation which in any
case is extremely uncomfortable, but is absolutely deadly to an intended
impression of solemnity. To be late, even when one is not to blame for it, does
not specially become anybody, and can make one ridiculous if it is made with an
air of punctuality. Moreover, the best of doctors does not cut a particularly
good figure <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vis-à-vis</i> a dead person
whom he had hoped to save; for although, on the one hand, one knows very well
and readily admits that the art of medicine is nothing less, and could and
should be nothing less, than the art of making man immortal, yet one could not,
on the other hand, take it in ill part if some people in such a situation
should think that not to be able to help is an art which others could also
practise. To evade such a comparison, or at least to cut it short, his
Magnificence the Doctor now sneaks quietly away and leaves it to the less
sensitive ear of the apothecary to listen to the mourners' complaints about our
lack of knowledge and the fruitless expenses. </p>

(for there is also a living one here) which was to be picked over today for the
last time, and half a pig's head, an animal which in life must have had its
food worries and which, after death, through being frequently borne to and fro
between larder and table, must obviously have suffered still more through
desiccation. Although the palate is, as we see, but moderately provided for,
eye and imagination are the more richly feasted. They are catered for by some
heavy and ostentatiously magnificent silver plate, and particularly by a view
of the Thames. With the latter, the generous man has really been somewhat
extravagant today; he has opened both window casements: one would have been
enough. There is hardly any evidence of plates for guests except a small one,
apparently a family meridometer for soup and vegetables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What the huge ornamental silver vessel with the handles
might contain is difficult to say; that is, of course, as far as one cannot see
inside it; for as far as one can see, it is obviously empty. If, as is
probable, the sly landlord has made good by the vessel what was lacking in
drink, then it might at any rate contain stale beer—and still be an expensive-
looking drink. The content of the silver jug on the floor is apparently
honest-to-goodness, pure Middlesex 1745 from the Thames. This then is the meal
at which death has overtaken the fair guest. Of course the poison was to blame.
But indeed, for an appetite and digestive powers such as the <a
href="../marriage5/arrest.htm">policeman on the fifth Plate</a> must have
possessed, such a dinner, if repeated for only a few days, would surely have
been followed by similar sad consequences. We need only look at the living
joint there, the <a href="dog.htm">dog</a>! Poor devil! Luckily for him, they
are mourning the death of the daughter of the house, for otherwise they would
surely have been mourning his to- day. He helps himself without recourse to the
meridometer. Well done! There is certainly no one among our readers who would
not wish the good animal a happy retreat with his booty. But it is difficult to
see how such a retreat is possible, and to devour the booty before the enemy's
very eyes is out of the question. To outflank the right wing is entirely
impossible; the old man is in command there in person, and with the keen,
constant wakefulness of a watch-dog, knows equally well how to guard diamond
rings and old joints. It would thus seem more expedient either to out- flank
the left wing, where there is at any rate some mutiny, or to break through the
legs of the apothecary so as to get in front of the old doctor and the
departing soul, on whose discretion he can rely, and thus get ahead of her. Let
us hope for the best. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In the magnificent bow window with its stained glass, the
domestic dragon with her dust-and-spider broom has evidently gashed in a few
ugly ventilation holes which gave the old man an excuse for dispensing with
cleaning altogether, lest the whole window be turned into a ventilator. A
cross-spider has taken advantage of this peacefulness to spread out her net in
safety.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this connection one can
hardly fail to remember Churchill's verse in which he describes Scotland,
though, of course, with southern, anti-Scottish malice, as the promised land
'where half-starv'd spiders feed on half-starv'd flies'. For in very truth if
the alderman does not feed his flies better than his dogs, then the
above-mentioned crusader might indeed find itself in the position of its
Scottish fellow-knights, since in this household even the skeleton of a dog
falls upon the dried specimen of a pig. In the matter of repairing the
transient, this man has his own methods. He has not attempted to patch up the
window panes, not even with sugar paper, which does not look too bad as a rule,
but, instead, he has worked on the backs of the ornamental chairs, and that in
a way which does not look particularly well. Our readers will notice that the <a
href="chair.htm">fallen chair</a> must have had a similar fall before, in which
both back supports were broken. These have not, perhaps, been glued on but, at
least on one side, been reinforced by a stout splinter, which is really much
more solid. As far as the appearance goes, it is certain that the mend will be
quite invisible to anyone sitting in the chair, and hardly noticeable to others
either. The only questionable point is the lack of symmetry in the patching.
Indeed, it seems almost as if the splinter on the right is intended at the same
time to cover the fracture on the left, since there the parts seem somewhat out
of alignment; it may also be that the fracture is new, and once the chair was
on its feet again, that little matter would soon correct itself. Little tobacco
pipes are to be seen in various parts of the room, one on the window and even
three in the small cupboard which contains the business papers. With such care
does this parsimonious creature preserve something which every day-labourer in
England throws away after he has used it, since he will get another for nothing
together with the smallest drink he orders. But since, if I am right, the
water-drinkers get nothing, he might be excused on that account. </p>

and, finally, the thickest of them all1 next to the cupboard door, entitled <i

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In the lower part
of the bookcase, next to the pipes, stands a home-made tobacco pouch made out of
a twisted quarto sheet, and, probably, a bottle of ink. Perhaps, however, the
bottle contains an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ipse fecit</i> for the
stomach to take of a Sunday morning in well water. The absolutely taste- less
insipidity of this cupboard is relieved, at least from the gable end downwards,
by an old inverted punch bowl. Since time, aided by careless- ness, has
already, as one sees, cut a second spoon groove in its rim, it seems to rest up
there in honourable retirement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The adornments of the walls are, of course, less showy
than those of the Squanderfields under the last two governments, but they are
at least English workmanship through and through. The alderman's hat and gown
hang on the pegs; next to them an English clock, probably with works of English
wood. To judge by the calibre of the bell, its stroke and alarum regulate the
business of the house on all floors. The hands point to five minutes past
eleven. Dinner at this hour is not the worst institution in this household.
Even from a miser it is possible to learn something. Eleven o'clock in the
morning is even late for a man who at four is already poring over his rent
book. In the West End of the City they sit down to dinner when here in the East
End it is already five o'clock. This gives the City of London a moral extension
in length of six hours' time, corresponding to 90° longitude. Should it
increase still more, which seems very probable, and should the King of Spain
start boasting again that the sun never sets on his realm, then every Cockney
could confidently reply that his home town alone is already so great that the
sun, wherever it may be, always finds some family at dinner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The remaining decoration consists of three paintings,
apart from an almanack stuck on the wall. The originals were not, as one sees,
of the Italian school; they were never turned out like that in Southern Europe
under a clear sky and on volcanic earth, but in some North- Western corner of
our continent on alluvial peat soil and in a somewhat heavy, misty atmosphere.
The largest of them contains the portraits—one could not call them speaking
likenesses but rather tantalizing likenesses— of a leg of mutton, roasted on
the spit, heads of cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, etc., all executed so
appetizingly that the naked appearance of the pig's head on the table could not
compete with them. This is what art can do. In addition, we see here stable
lights which lack nothing but oily stickiness, little herring barrels complete
apart from the smell, swill rags charming to put in one's pocket, if only they
would not seem to drip like real ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Almost a quarter of this still-lifeless nature the owner
has covered with a live Tenters, and thereby has given that kitchen paradise,
so to speak, an inmate. A real masterpiece, this, by that Raphael of the
Netherlands. It hangs there above the almanack, apparently in place of a
morning devotion for the strengthening of the moral feelings, which, after all,
is the purpose of all painting and was especially the whole endeavour of
Raphael, the Teniers of Urbino. Even if that purpose should be somewhat out of
place here, it is at least possible to test by this item of the morning routine
whether one still has some moral feeling. It represents a <a href="pic1.htm">great
empty drinking vessel</a> and another still more roomy, somewhat overfull,
which have evidently exchanged their contents. The piece is not a complete
Tenters, for in his works one sees at least a great number of faces everywhere.
Is it perhaps cut out from a whole canvas, or did it alone survive from some
destruction of the rest? This seems to me highly probable, since merely to
represent that <a href="urine.htm">simple process of filtration</a> of Dutch
drinks, even a Dutchman would hardly undertake for the sake of its moral
implications. But if it is a salvaged cutting, then it is again queer and
contrary to an established procedure that in a wholesale destruction only that
figure should survive who at the wall—looks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Above the door hangs the third painting, also of the Bog school. This
marvellous picture can bear more than one interpretation. Either one of the
figures is <a href="pic2.htm">burning a nose-wart off the other with his pipe</a>—such
a thing might be possible; or Hogarth was thinking of Shakespeare and
Bardolph's nose which glowed in the dark like a coal, and the man is now merely
re-lighting his pipe at it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Without my drawing attention to it, the reader will have
noticed that Hogarth in his pictures, by means of the wall decorations, pokes
fun partly at Biblical murder stories and the subtle obscenities of the
Italians, partly at the more peaceful cochonneries of the Dutch. As is usually
the case with every man of value, he thinks himself better than anyone else.
Bravo! Without such a faith not even a grain of sand can be moved, let alone
mountains; so, in Heaven's name let us carry on like that; this procedure is
most advantageous to the savings-box of Time and of Humanity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>I return once more to the most prominent exhibit of the
lunch-time scene, the view of the Thames. The <a href="outside.htm">row of
houses</a> which we see are the famous, and ultimately infamous, buildings on
the bridge itself, which is 915 ft. long and 72 ft. broad. Before the year 1756
it still had those rows of houses on each side to a depth of 26 ft., so that
between them there still remained a 20 ft. broad street. Towards the year 1746
these buildings had become so decayed that the inhabitants of the upper storeys
ran the unusual risk of being drowned in the next storm, and the sailors the no
less remarkable risk of being killed on board ship by falling bricks and tiles.
The leaning of these houses towards the miraculous Hogarth has expressed
unmistakably. He did this in 1745, and in the following year Parliament decreed
the abolition of these houses. I say decreed, for they were demolished only in
1756. That is how things go in this world. But still Parliament was
immeasurably more lucky in its intention with these houses than was Hogarth
with the present work. The houses disappeared ultimately; our good man,
however, wished to eliminate marriages <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>à</i>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>la mode,</i> but according to the latest
news from England they still exist (139-151). </p>
