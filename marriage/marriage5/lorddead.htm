    that light which illumines for us here the signs of approaching death in his 
    sunken cheek and fallen jaw. In vain does the whine of despairing depravity 
    rise up to him from the lips of that abandoned woman; in vain her supplication 
    for mercy for crime discovered. His ears no longer hear them, and his mouth 
    no longer responds. Between the two of them, accusation and defence have come

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>At
this point, a few words about the falling sword. As a telling detail in the
delineation of the story itself it hardly calls for explanation. A moment ago
the dying man still held it in his hand, that is what the artist wants to say,
and the very next moment, that is, the one which has here been seized and fixed
by art, it is already too heavy for him; it falls, or rather it stands
there&#8212;like its master. That is all. Now a little about this presentation,
partly as a work of art, partly about the present reproduction of the picture;
not through literary importunity, but because of certain criticisms which have
been raised by friends of mine, and which might easily be made by some of my
readers. I start with the last point. In the original engraving, which must be
clearly distinguished from the original picture, the dying man supports himself
with his left arm, and the sword thus seems to have fallen from his right hand.
What is more natural than that, one would say, for surely he held the sword in
his right? But this apparently justified objection can immediately be countered
by the fact that in the original engraving his Lordship wears that part of the
sword belt on which the sword had been hanging, on his right, whereas in our
reproduction it hangs properly on the left. His Lordship, while he was still
standing unsupported, apparently flung the sword away and sank against the
table which stood on his right. In our reproduction we also see the right hand
of the scribe, or whoever he is up there over the doorway, restored to its
eternal and unalienable right which in the original engraving it had apparently
ceded to the left. Thus here, too, Mr Riepenhausen's reproduction is in
agreement with the original painting. Now to the first point. It has pleased me
not a little that almost everyone to whom I have shown these engravings has
found the position of the sword unnatural. And why did it please me? Answer:
because I am confident that I could easily elicit from anybody who felt like
that after some slight subjection to Socrates' torture, some theorems of higher
mathematics. He feels, without expressly knowing it, that the painter of the
living and moving&#8212; just because his painted representation is still and
without life&#8212;ought to present only an infinitely small moment of time,
and he also feels that the infinitely small moments of time must preserve their
relations with one another, for otherwise the falling of a sword inclined
towards the horizon, with its heavy sword hilt on top, could not be found
unnatural if compared with the falling of its master. Now the sinking master
could still hold, or have held, himself up; not so the sword. There lies the
difference. On the coat-of-arms of a knight on the point of falling we might
still read the device, but we could hardly do so with the name of the
sword-smith or the factory of a sword falling in that way. The position of his
Lordship approaches that of rest, that of the falling sword more the motion of
the cannon ball which in the first picture flew out of the hero's trouser
pocket (134-135). </p>
