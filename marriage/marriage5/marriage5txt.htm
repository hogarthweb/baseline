is the most explicit and specific in assigning blame to parents for the deaths
that occur in the series. By the time we have reached plate 5, we have already
seen the Count and Countess <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield's</span> arranged
marriage and their separate assignations borne from their inherent
incompatibility. In this plate, we most clearly see what <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has hinted for four previous plates—the blamelessness, even martyrdom, of the
young couple's actions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Despite his own aristocratic
indulgences, <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield’s</span> death ironically results
from his wife’s indiscretions and his attempt to impose a sort of double
standard on her. The <a href="lady.htm">countess</a> and her <a
href="escape.htm">lover,</a> the lawyer <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>
(not insignificantly the writer of the marriage contract), have retired for <a
href="discarded.htm">post-masquerade</a> dalliances, only to be surprised by
the count. When a duel ensues, the <a href="lorddead.htm">count</a> is killed,
and <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span> is escaping as the <a
href="arrest.htm">night watch</a> bursts into the room. The placement of the
swords indicates the emasculation of the count.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Cowley states that <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span> is the
“nearest to indecency” (130) of any figure in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One can ponder the moral, as well as physical
implications of this comment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus,
although <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> engages in immoral behavior
himself, his death results from his wife’s dalliances.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cowley notes that former commentators have
condemned the bride’s “insubordination” in the series (38-39).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This concern gives the infidelities of the
middle-class wife more import than those of the husband.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawrence Stone relates that extramarital
affairs among the aristocracy were “expected” if not morally sanctioned (330-331).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

factor here, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> does indict female sexual
appetite as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wife’s discarded
clothing and mask indicate that she has been to a masquerade.<span

masquerade culture links the parties with the compromise of female virtue.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Promiscuous
freedom enjoyed by women at masquerades is a constant theme in anti-masquerade
writing . . . [Masquerades are a] comprehensible reaction to the horrific
repression enjoined upon <span class=SpellE>respectiable</span> women . . .
middle-class women were expected to show few signs of sexual desire, even
within marriage. (43-44)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>As evidenced in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Harlot’s

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>He has
indeed borrowed and injected a part of the traditional Harlot's story from the
popular Italian print cycles that he did not use in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Harlot's Progress</i>: the rivalry of lovers for the harlot's favors,
which leads to the fatal duel. The pictures on the walls of the countess'
boudoir may have been suggested by those in the parlor of the whore, Sarah
Millwood, George Barnwell's seducer, described in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The History of George Barnwell</i>...the bawd of the Harlot's Progress
has now become the parent. (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life</i> vol.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Paulson
also notes that the Harlot ultimately has some choice of her life's direction,
where there is no such choice in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marriage

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>.</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Considering the <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> marriage
legalized prostitution suggests another comparison often made of the
countess—to Mary Magdalene. In this schema, Lord <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>
becomes the Christ figure; as Paulson notes, his awkward death pose even
recalls the prints Crucifixion and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Descent
from the Cross</i> both of which feature Magdalene attending Christ as the
countess here attends her husband's side (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life</i>
vol.1 486). This comparison is further emphasized by the <a href="ceiling.htm">cross
on the door</a>. The countess, then, becomes the redeemed whore, and her
conniving, adulterous husband is rendered impotent and is transformed into a
martyr, sacrificed on the altar of parental greed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another reference to prostitution is seen in
the <a href="moll.htm">portrait of the prostitute</a> and her squirrel in the
visual center of the picture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Religious
and political significance is added by the barely visible mural of the Judgment
of Solomon in the background of the plate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span></span>In the fifth scene the shimmer 
    turns to darkness and blood. <a href="escape.htm"><span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span></a> 
    and the <a href="lady.htm">Countess</a> have retreated to the Turk's Head 
    bagnio - the flames of the fire shine on a <a href="discarded.htm">mask, a 
    set of stays and a <span class=SpellE>hooped</span> petticoat</a>, and the 
    masquerade costumes of a nun and friar lie crumpled on the floor. The <a
href="lorddead.htm">pursuing Earl</a> has burst in upon them and in a fast, chaotic 
    duel <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span> has stabbed him to the heart. 
    Now the lawyer, bare-legged, is clambering from the window, lit by a guttering 
    candle, and the <a href="arrest.htm">watch</a> thrusts through the door, their 
    horror caught in a lantern's glare. The fiercely lit triangle at the heart 
    of the picture is framed in the angle of two swords, one quivering, piercing 
    the floor, the other covered in blood. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Suddenly, the poses of religious 
    martyrdom, so far confined to the pictures on their walls, are given to the 
    main characters themselves. The dying husband with blood staining his shirt 
    strains back against the table, his body curved like Christ's in a Renaissance 
    deposition, but with no one to support him; his young wife kneels like a <span
class=SpellE>Magdalen</span>, clasping her hands in penitence. Part of the shock 
    comes from the sense of blasphemous travesty, yet this too is 'a la mode' 
    --from the Restoration onwards grand ladies of the Court had, as Pope said, 
    enjoyed being painted as <span class=SpellE>Magdalens</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet beneath the double irony there is that familiar, 
    ironic <span class=SpellE>Hogarthian</span> insistence that real life can 
    be a crucifixion, without a mythic promise of redemption (381-382).</p>
  <p>Even in the bagnio there is a tapestry of the Judgment of Solomon, obscured 
    by a portrait of a <a href="moll.htm">huge-breasted prostitute</a> dressed 
    as a shepherdess.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Above the door where 
    the watch bursts in hangs a portrait of <a href="pic1.htm">St. Luke</a> with 
    his ox—patron of doctors (too late) and also of the artists, recording and 
    freezing the action—like the appalled Medusa in the opening scene (386).</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is appropriate,

    a <span class=SpellE>Magdalen</span>—a prostitute—mourning Christ, who died 
    for her sins.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The traditional story 
    of the <span class=SpellE>Magdalen</span> was actually rather close to that 
    of the countess: she was born of a good family, but after her marriage her 
    husband deserted her and she turned to a life of sin and was possessed by 
    seven devils.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    probably remembered too, as a student of English portraiture, how Charles 
    <span
class=SpellE>II’s</span> mistress, the Duchess of Cleveland, had been painted 
    in the pose of an erotically-stimulating but dubiously repentant <span
class=SpellE>Magdalen</span> in a wilderness—etched and transmitted to the general 
    public by <span class=SpellE>Faithorne</span>—as well as in the pose of St. 
    Catherine, St. Barbara, Minerva, and others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Horace Walpole tells us how one of these representations, 
    this time with the Duchess as a Madonna holding one of her royal bastards, 
    hung over the altar until its true subject was discovered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the countess, the <span class=SpellE>Magdalen</span> 
    pose follows from her pictures of Io and Lot’s daughters on the walls of her 
    boudoir.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The tapestry 
    on the wall of the bagnio shows <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The 
    Judgment of Solomon</i> (I Kings 4): appropriately, the story of two harlots 
    who claimed the same baby.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Solomon’s 
    judgment, of course, was to cut the baby in two and give each “mother” half, 
    at which the true mother proved herself by giving way to the other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prostitutes would be interested in stories of 
    other prostitutes, especially sanctified by a biblical subject and the treatment 
    of the old masters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But to continue 
    to ponder the tapestry is to move from the court and the judgment to <span
class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>, a counselor by profession, who has in a sense 
    given the <span class=GramE>countess</span> Solomon’s judgment; but she, unlike 
    the true mother, has allowed the division to take place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By a curious redistribution, the tapestry has 
    become an analogue to the scene, with Solomon equivalent to <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>, 
    the prostitute to the countess, and the sacrificial babe to the count.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the tapestry of Solomon and the “mothers” 
    emphasizes the element of choice that has now, however much the characters 
    may have originally been compelled, moved to the fore, the Deposition poses 
    of the dying count-Christ (with the wound in his side) and the countess-<span class=SpellE>Magdalen</span> 
    emphasize the element of sacrifice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
    fragmentation of roles that is implied by these parallels is underlined by 
    the portrait on the wall of a harlot in the pose and costume of a shepherdess, 
    with all the associations of pastoral purity; showing beneath the frame of 
    the picture are the hefty legs of a soldier (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life

him. The only support left him, his arm, grows more and more powerless with
each precarious beat of his pierced heart. He may stand for a few moments
longer and then—never again. His breaking eye no longer sees the light, that
light which illumines for us here the signs of approaching death in his sunken
cheek and fallen jaw. In vain does the whine of despairing depravity rise up to
him from the lips of that abandoned woman; in vain her supplication for mercy
for crime discovered. His ears no longer hear them, and his mouth no longer

as did formerly the French king's murderers, as long as there were only a

the arms, too. This is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mode,</i> it is

even her numbed sense of <span class=SpellE>honour</span> seems re-awakened

pictures his perhaps over-solemn introduction to this Chapter. He was just
expressing his own feelings. The main content of the piece, I feel, <span

gentleman who makes his exit through the window there were less visible, or at
least better covered than he is. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> intention
was evidently to arouse terror, hatred, and revulsion with the first glance at
this scene, and this he has certainly achieved. Of course, he could not
entirely refrain from indulging his impish mood even here. But these features
(with the possible exception of the large features in the window there) are all
so much concealed that they really have to be looked for, and have therefore
often been overlooked as well. They disturb the main impression so little that,
on the contrary, it is they which, through the force of that main impression,
are hardly noticed. But even if these touches were less recondite, what sort of
human feelings would they be that would remain unmoved by such a scene, simply because
the story was enacted in a ridiculously furnished room, or because at the same
time there appear in it a few persons in queer attitudes? I am so little
apprehensive of this reaction from my readers that I shall not hesitate to
bring all these touches to their notice, and I am convinced that once they have
considered them, they will themselves return them where they belong. </p>

had, as will be recalled, a date for the <a href="discarded.htm">Masked Ball</a>,
and they did in fact meet there. Excited by dancing and probably also by Lot's
cup, they remember the miracles of the masked Jupiter, pointed out to them by <span
class=SpellE>Giulio</span> Romano and Michelangelo, and, as true pupils of <span
class=SpellE>Crébillon</span>, they leave the Olympus of the ballroom,
glittering with countless lights, and settle themselves in the dirtiest corner
of a so-called Bagnio, a sort of house which is open at all hours of the night
to any miracle worker, and especially to those who descend from such a
height.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lord <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>,
who has got scent of the exploit, sneaks along behind them with sword drawn,
bursts open the locked and bolted door (key and cross-bar are lying on the
floor) and finds what he was looking for, completely unmasked, without domino
and even without clothes, except for one quilt to cover both, which didn't
amount to much. He rushes at the advocate. That much experienced, legally
cautious fox also carries, at this delicate appointment, a sword, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>subsidium</span> <span
class=SpellE>iuris</span>,</i> and before the attack can materialize he flings
himself out of the quilt and confronts his furious adversary in the open. A
fight begins, and one, alas! <span class=GramE>in</span> which horns are no
help whatever. For rage, resolute and nimble though it may be as a murderer, is
notoriously the poorest fencer in the world. To be brief, Lord <span
class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> rushes on to the sword of the advocate and
falls. After this victory, the lighter part of the garrison emerges from under
the quilt to celebrate it as victories are usually celebrated in civil wars.
This is the celebration. In that sortie she entangles herself in the sheet,
drags it after her and apparently falls. Here again, her character is in the
balance. Did she sink on to her knee intentionally, or has she merely forgotten
to rise? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In the uproar, the <a href="arrest.htm">night-watch</a>
awakes, rouses the landlord, finally even the police. There they stand, the
whole bunch, in the doorway, partly visible, partly indicated, and arranged in
the most natural order in the world, namely according to the interest of the
parties. First of all, the landlord, with the five exclamation marks on his
left hand and a face which, if times do not soon improve, might well <span
class=GramE>be</span> worth storing among the printing blocks. The <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> of his house is at stake. Behind him stands the
constable, the representative of the police, with his staff. A lovely figure,
and one that can be seen by the hundred in England; a genuine tough composition
of beef and pudding, tawny red, shining, stocky and stout with enough behind
for two; slightly in advance of him a digestive apparatus of the most
comfortable curvature, the true symbol of national debt and taxation pressure.
His right hand rests admonishingly on the landlord's shoulder; he seems to
recommend cool blood and caution. It is no use having too much heart in cases
like this, especially when naked swords are flashing about; if it were
wine-glasses, or fragments of them, one might perhaps do something more. The
night-watchman, still more cautious than the police, heads the detachment, from
behind; he dare not do anything nor does he want to; he does not even issue
orders, he merely holds the light. We see nothing of him but the right hand
holding the lantern, whose ventilation holes are projected on to the ceiling of
the room according to the rules of perspective and there become a sort of
canopy over a throne, which we shall mention in its proper place. <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span>, though sure of
his victory, yet takes to flight on account of that small detachment. As an
advocate he would know better than anyone that the welfare belly there in the
door belonged to the lesser troops of an invincible corps, namely the English
Criminal Law Administration, and that this corps is rarely far away when such
advance troops appear on the scene. But he seems especially apprehensive about
a certain person employed only occasionally in that service, quite an
unimportant person, by the way, whose acquaintance, however, cannot always be
avoided, and who then becomes something of a nuisance—the hangman. That
accounts for the great haste and the retreat by an outlet to the street from
the second storey, with a rather abbreviated flight of steps which begins on
the window-ledge and ends on the street itself. Moreover, it is a flight in
winter, for the main illumination in this picture comes from the fireplace, and
it is a windy night since the flame of the light indicates a sneezing draught
between window and door. It is hard at such a time to be <span class=SpellE>despatched</span>
like that, especially in one's summer coat. No victor surely has ever taken
flight more scantily clothed. We can almost see <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span> in his entirety up to his silver mouth, which
is concealed here by his shoulder. What a ridiculous figure is cut by guilt
when forced to expose itself in the so-called robe of innocence, from an angle
which even innocence would regard as double nakedness. His position is awkward:
he is about to leap out of the window from the second floor (for we do not see
any window-sill), and straight down, silver mouth first, without climbing. It
will be a dangerous jump. But then, what will a man not do to avoid
acquaintance with the lower officials of the administration of Criminal
Justice? It almost seems as if he wanted to throw something down in advance,
perhaps a <span class=GramE>pillow,</span> or something in the nature of an
overcoat, or some underwear especially. For if <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
had intended to expose him on the street to the passers-by, or since they would
be asleep, to some night-watchman, without pants, then he would probably have
shown us somewhere the pants without the man. But of these there is no trace,
although parts of the battlefield are strewn with armaments which might
properly be termed their counterparts, such as whale-bone harness of all sorts
for hand-to-hand and distant fighting, corsets and crinolines, hoods, masks,
embroidered dancing slippers, swords and scabbards, and so on. In its sudden
sortie from the bastion the young garrison came by mistake, it seems, upon the
field medicine chest, knocked it over, and broke open some little boxes,
releasing a hail of grape-shot (which pharmacy has taught us to cast from a
well-known cold liquid metal), or whatever diabolic concoction that may be
which is rolling about there under the address of that fine establishment and
its landlord, as if under the protection of a patent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE>Next to the corset lies something else
for unlacing, to wit, a <a href="cross.htm">bundle of faggots</a>; not unlike
the former in appearance and very similar in stiffness.</span> We may be sure
that our artist has not thrown these two fascines so closely together for
nothing; <span class=GramE>nor</span>, in all probability, the two sticks which
in the form of a sword point murderously at the nearer bundle. That almost
looks like suicide. Oh, there are certainly prophetic voices in this room! And
the sword there in the lower fascine presages very little comfort for the upper
one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The faggots are lying in front of the fireplace, as we
infer from the shadow of the tongs which stretches along the floor beyond the
murderer's sword. It is thrown by the same light which illuminates the main
group. But the fact that they bum half-rotten faggots here instead of coal,
throws, by the rules of another perspective, yet another light upon this room.
In a great city at least, and especially in public establishments, this, to the
best of my knowledge, would always be evidence of disreputable stinginess, and
in this case it shows what a <span class=SpellE>cosy</span> little comer the
good people have chosen. <span class=GramE>Whether fire-tongs standing near a
considerable fire could throw so sharp a shadow need not be more closely
investigated here.</span> The shadow is merely a half-artificial device to
indicate the fire in the fireplace: it does not seem to be an entirely natural
one. It is not the first time that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has used
shadows in his pictures and, just as unnaturally, merely to indicate the
presence of objects which he could not actually bring before our eyes. Also, it
is difficult to see how these tongs would have to be placed in front of such a
fire in order to throw such a shadow, since they seem to be neither leaning nor
hanging. They would, apparently, have to be stuck in some crevice of the
fireplace, or to be a pair of falling tongs, just like the falling rapier over
there which also throws a somewhat unnatural shadow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE>At this point, a few words about the
falling sword.</span> As a telling detail in the delineation of the story
itself it hardly calls for explanation. A moment ago the dying man still held
it in his hand, that is what the artist wants to say, and the very next moment,
that is, the one which has here been seized and fixed by art, it is already too
heavy for him; it falls, or rather it stands there—like its master. That is
all. Now a little about this presentation, partly as a work of art, partly
about the present reproduction of the picture; not through literary
importunity, but because of certain criticisms which have been raised by
friends of mine, and which might easily be made by some of my readers. I start
with the last point. In the original engraving, which must be clearly
distinguished from the original picture, the dying man supports himself with
his left arm, and the sword thus seems to have fallen from his right hand. What
is more natural than that, one would say, for surely he held the sword in his
right? But this apparently justified objection can immediately be countered by
the fact that in the original engraving his Lordship wears that part of the
sword belt on which the sword had been hanging, on his right, whereas in our
reproduction it hangs properly on the left. His Lordship, while he was still
standing unsupported, apparently flung the sword away and sank against the
table which stood on his right. In our reproduction we also see the right hand
of the scribe, or whoever he is up there over the doorway, restored to its
eternal and unalienable right which in the original engraving it had apparently
ceded to the left. Thus here, too, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Riepenhausen's</span> reproduction is in agreement with the
original painting. <span class=GramE>Now to the first point.</span> It has
pleased me not a little that almost everyone to whom I have shown these
engravings has found the position of the sword unnatural. And why did it please
me? Answer: because I am confident that I could easily elicit from anybody who
felt like that after some slight subjection to Socrates' torture, some theorems
of higher mathematics. He feels, without expressly knowing it, that the painter
of the living and moving— just because his painted representation is still and
without life—ought to present only an infinitely small moment of time, and he
also feels that the infinitely small moments of time must preserve their
relations with one another, for otherwise the falling of a sword inclined
towards the horizon, with its heavy sword hilt on top, could not be found
unnatural if compared with the falling of its master. Now the sinking master
could still hold, or have held, himself up; not so the sword. There lies the
difference. On the coat-of-arms of a knight on the point of falling we might
still read the device, but we could hardly do so with the name of the
sword-smith or the factory of a sword falling in that way. The position of his
Lordship approaches that of rest, that of the falling sword more the motion of
the cannon ball which in the first picture flew out of the hero's trouser
pocket. </p>

cannot quite be discerned) the Judgment of Solomon. Solomon on the throne,
though except perhaps for the crown, not in his usual <span class=SpellE>splendour</span>,
but rather in the holiday attire of a Dutch sailor. Anyone not aware that this
man was once at the helm of a powerful State, which he guided with great
wisdom, would be inclined to believe that here, at least, he was guiding some
coal barge or herring smack under the powerful influence of greed, rum and
schnapps which clearly glow out of his eye and nose. Nor are the inanimate
ornaments of the throne much more attractive than the animate ones. Not so much
a terrible as a terribly-drawn lion's head, and a throne canopy with ten
magnificent suns embroidered by the <span class=SpellE>sombre</span> rays of a
stable <span class=GramE>lamp, that</span> is all! Before him stands the mother
of the child that is about to be divided according to the principles of
equality. Were she not grasping it so anxiously to prevent that division of the
apple other eye, one would almost be inclined, judging from her face, to regard
her as the father. For head and headgear are entirely masculine, and nautical
to boot, and for the sake of touches like these one could overlook a few small
items such as, for instance, that she wears a skirt and is apparently again in
an unmistakably interesting condition. That the beadle is about to chop up the
child with his left hand is again no argument against <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>
<span class=SpellE>Riepenhausen's</span> omission to reverse the original painting.
Solomon here holds the <span class=SpellE>sceptre</span> in his right hand, as
we feel sure he always held it. His wisdom required this of him, and this way
of re- presenting him must therefore be the rule for every artist who
undertakes to portray him in all his glory. What does a single left-handed
rogue of an inferior official matter? Oh, if we were immediately to reverse the
whole picture because some inferior official performs something with his left
hand that a wise governor has ordained with his right—there would be no end to
reversals in this world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Apart from this Old Testament story, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has hung two other pictures from the Newest Testament, which offer a peculiar
contrast, if not with the wall paper, at least with one another. The one, we
are assured, is the portrait of a certain <a href="moll.htm">Moll Flanders</a>,
a notorious <st1:Street><st1:address>Drury Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>
trollop (<span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
calls her, in his somewhat peculiar language, 'notified'). At the first glance,
her appearance has something repulsive in it, which how- ever more or less disappears
once one has discovered the happy union of cowherd and affected fine lady, and
it vanishes completely as soon as the intention of the whimsical artist is
revealed, for he has really put her here in the pillory. She has a squirrel
perched on her hand, a little dandy too, and behind is a parrot in its ring,
also a chatterbox, evidently a cut at other affected damsels, not those of the
cowshed but of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bel-étage</i></span>
of the house itself. But joking apart, such companions really have something to
contribute. These little animals lend to lady owners of a certain age something
of their own daintiness and, what is hardly less valuable, divert somewhat the
lover's attention where too much of it might become embarrassing. In a word, as
soon as two lovers, desiring to entertain one another, begin to forget their
mother-tongue, which sometimes happens in the third quarter of life, or if they
find themselves at a loss for something to talk about, or hesitate and wait for
the prompter in their head, then a parrot and a squirrel may work wonders. The
object which hangs down there from her right hand I have always regarded as the
head of a riding crop. <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Ireland, however, states
dogmatically it is a butcher's steel. Possibly it is, but what in <span
class=GramE>all the</span> world could that woman have to steel or to sharpen? <span
class=GramE>Now for the pillory.</span> With genuine roguishness and with truly
appropriate malice, our artist has hung the picture of this piece so that the
legs of one of the fellows in Solomon's Swiss Guard on the wallpaper appear to be
hers, and it looks as if her skirt had been cut off above the knee without her
even having noticed it. This last circumstance makes the matter really
interesting. That lucky cut, to be sure, transforms the creature into a
Highlander, without the Highlander's famous second sight having given her the
slightest inkling of it, although it happened in such close proximity that
there was not even any need for a special gift of vision to discover it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The second picture hanging on the wallpaper is—the mirror.
<span class=GramE>And why?</span> Oh! <span class=GramE>it</span> was certainly
not without intention that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> hung the mirror
there, so that its frame becomes at the same time a frame for the head of the
dying man. 'If,' he seems to adjure foolish vanity, 'If you do not feel cured
of your madness by a glance in that first mirror with the Highlander and the
squirrel, very well, then look into the second! How's that? Do you recognize
the make-up which covers those cheeks? What do you say? Oh! whoever in the
world you may be, sooner or later the time will surely come when your mirror
will look back at you like this one, little though you may then be capable of
realizing that the features which it reflects with its wonted truthfulness are
your own.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Over the door hangs a third picture, which deserves attention.
This time the subject is taken from the New Testament and, as can be seen from
the halo of the man with the bull, evidently represents the <a href="pic1.htm">apostle
Luke</a>, known to be the patron of artists, as <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has correctly observed. He thus portrays here the remarkable story, and, as one
sees, with the utmost zeal and close attention. Even the horned animal appears
to be curious about what is going on down there. Perhaps it has the scent of
the one who has just been butchered, at whose <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>papillotes</i></span> yesterday morning
brother <span class=SpellE>Acteon</span> so mysteriously pointed. But I believe
this is by no means all there is to it, and venture therefore an additional
explanation, the more readily since it has obtained the full approval of a
discerning Englishman and an expert on <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
inexhaustible fund of allegory. London has, in common with all large towns,
apart from a number of private lunatic asylums, two great public institutions
for that purpose, which are pretty well known everywhere, Bedlam and St Luke's.
The latter is particularly for incurables. That name and the hospital which
bears it are so well known and their association so familiar to everyone that
out of a hundred who hear the name pronounced, ninety-nine will think of the
lunatic asylum rather than the apostle. Now our Saint Luke here, although the
patron of painters, but just as surely also the patron of the hospital,
evidently holds a pen, not a pencil, in his hand, as we can see very clearly in
the original engraving. Thus he is writing. Might he not therefore be entering
in his register the names of those three candidates as very deserving inmates
for his institution? They have lived madly enough at least, all three of them,
and incurable they are too in another sense. It is possible to draw with a pen,
to be sure, but this does not invalidate the last suggestion; on the contrary,
the satire gains, through just that re- <span class=SpellE>inforcement</span>,
its two-<span class=SpellE>edgedness</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

It is possible that Lord <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>, after
learning that his bed-fellow had been seen together with her lover in a house
of ill-fame, proceeded more cautiously and more in accordance with English law
than I have indicated above. He may have obtained a warrant, and thus arrived,
together with the constable, at the house which without that measure he could
not have ventured to enter by force. They burst the door open together, under
the protection of the police. His Lordship drew his sword, the civil war
between <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> &amp; Co. broke out and was
concluded; all in five minutes. Had it not even come to a fight, such witnesses
would always have been welcome for the sake of the divorce. If this was his
secondary purpose, then he achieved it too. The marriage is divorced. There,
under the shadow of the fire-tongs, lies what cut the marriage bond (129-138). </p>
