    fattened Italian capon sits the English domestic cock, desiccated in service; 
    in their extremes of physique, one worth as little as the other. There have 
    been many interpretations of that figure. Someone has even made a Prussian 
    Ambassador Michel out of it. Of course, many a Michel in this world may have 
    looked like that, and may look like it in the future, but, according to all 
    the rules of interpretation, this is certainly our hero, the Earl <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> himself 
    were to reject this interpretation, he would have only himself to blame for 
    being misunderstood. Of course, his Lordship appears thinner here than before, 
    and what is still queerer, thinner than later that evening. But what does 
    it matter? The dandy may have risen this morning but he is certainly not yet 
    roused. He is still only a caterpillar. His head is already in the chrysalis 
    state&#8212; the rest will follow, and before the dinner bell sounds the butterfly 
    will appear in all its glory. These are only trivialities; after all, hips 
    are neither here nor there. Since clothes have come to make the man. Nature 
    has lost much of its custom. It is certainly a little malicious of our artist 
    to serve up this half-transparent kipper together with the fattened Italian 
    carp, as if on one dish. <span class=GramE>For really the legs of his Lordship 
    are by no means the straws which they seem to a superficial observer.</span> 
    One need only cover over the two bamboo posts of the Italian, whose propinquity 
    is obviously harmful to his Lordship's, to see that the latter are still a 
    pair of legs upon which a man of some standing, who neither stands nor walks 
    very much, may still stand and walk quite passably. But what has <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    done? With unpardonable malice, he has intentionally covered over more than 
    half of his Lordship's left leg with the left leg of the Italian. Is that 
    right? Indeed, if to cover over shortcomings in this way is not worse than 
    to discover them, then I do not know the meaning of cover and discover. By 
    this method, of course, one could in a moment turn the stoutest walking-stick 
    of the most up-to-date Parisian dandy, or even of Hercules himself, into a 
    mere matchstick. Thus the whole argument against identifying the former and 
    future <span
class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> with this creature here, which is based upon 
    the feeble legs of the subject, <span class=GramE>itself</span> stands upon 
    very weak legs. Besides, for an artist of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> 
    vitality and wit, it would be harder than for others not to exaggerate the 
    contrast once he had hit upon the idea. Oh! <span class=GramE>the</span> best-trained 
    wit, ridden by Reason itself, may run away with its rider once such artistic 
    jumps are made. Then one usually tells only half the truth, or else six quarters 
    of it, which, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutatis mutandis,</i> 
    comes to very much the same thing. But now let us listen to the other side 
    of the argument: it must be Earl <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>, 
    for, in the first place, he sits there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>en 
    <span class=SpellE>papillotes</span>,</i> just as his love, or rather his 
    semi-wife, sits over there, not with her husband but merely with her lover. 
    He is waiting for the curling tongs of the Frenchman whom they both employ. 
    Nobody but a husband has the right to have himself nipped in that way at a 
    lady's levee. Thus they <span class=GramE>belong</span> together <span class=SpellE>serviliter</span> 
    at least; they are married <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>à</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> la mode.</i> Secondly, 
    just look at the head: is not that a horned animal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tout enticer?</i> And who in the wide world 
    could fail to see it? Even the little <a href="cuckold.htm">black boy</a> 
    there in the right-hand corner notices it and points with his finger at the 
    <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>papillotes</i></span> of a 
    miniature <span class=SpellE>Acteon</span> which has just arrived from the 
    auction. Yes, indeed brother <span class=SpellE>Acteon</span> with his ten-branched 
    antlers even seems to point with his stump of an arm at the member of his 
    Order, <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>, who has seven branches: &#8216;Just 
    look, isn't that one of ours too?' And the poor devil of a Lord really seems 
    to have just recognized his little brother. Oh he already feels a pinch in 
    some part of his being! For who would sip chocolate even the hottest, like 
    that, if he were not burning somewhere else as well? At present, his eye probably 
    sees as little as his ear hears or his tongue tastes; it is spiritual food 
    which he consumes or tries to digest perhaps a few paper sandwiches from his 
    steward, and something of the amorous collation to which <span
class=SpellE>Almazéï</span> is listening over there. He surely is the husband&#8212;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> 
    <span class=SpellE>à</span> la mode.</i></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Thirdly,
what speaks very strongly in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of this
interpretation is the expression, and even the attire, especially if one
compares it with the <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span> of the second
Plate. He loves fancy coats. Even at the scene of the catastrophe in the fifth
Plate, he wears one of these, whose cut is however different from that in the <a
href="../marriage2/mmm2small.htm">second Plate</a>. But, one might object, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bon-ton</i> plaster behind the ear is
missing. Answer: that is what happens to plasters in the night, and behind the
ear there really is something discernible which might well have deserved a one
inch <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bon-ton</i> plaster <span
class=GramE>It</span> is also the first time that our hero has <span
class=SpellE>favoured</span> us with his right ear- it was always the left that
we saw. That an evil which is usually symmetrical should have thus broken the
rule for once would, in this household at least (with the exception perhaps of
the mantelpiece ornaments in the second Plate), be precisely in order. A
stronger objection is one which I have raised myself: this gentleman has, if
else I see aright, a hat with a cockade under his arm, which, according to
English custom, would be an officer's hat. His Lordship is not an officer, to
be sure, but how if last night his Lordship has perhaps acted the officer, and
has only just returned home, as the other day, or that in the confusion he has
made an acquisition just as he did before? My readers may take their choice
here, if they find it worth their while. Perhaps their choice will be made
easier by the consideration that our hero might also have been brought into
such close contact with the Italian to demonstrate that if in this world a man
wished to acquire a sort of eunuch-credit for all kinds of courage and bravery,
he need not always use precisely the knife (119-122). </p>
