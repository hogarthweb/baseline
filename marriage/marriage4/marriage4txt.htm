    guests at her toilette---a much derided habit imported from France. The coronets 
    over her pink-canopied bed (its open curtains a salacious female invitation), 
    and over her gilt mirror, declare that her husband is now an Earl; the little 
    coral rattle hanging from her chair tells us that she has a child, making 
    the disease of the previous scene more ominous still. Neither change in status, 
    to mother or to Countess, has had a sobering effect. She tosses a cloth across 
    her shoulders to protect her yellow satin while the <span

style='color:blue'><a href="fluteplayer.htm">German flautist</a></span></u></span>. 
    A <span style='mso-field-code:
" HYPERLINK \0022man\.htm\0022 "'><u><span style='color:blue'><a href="man.htm">fop</a></span></u></span> 
    in curl-papers points his toe and sips his chocolate, an exaggeratedly over-perfect 
    illustration from Lairesse, who specified that it was correct to hold things 
    lightly and 'in appropriate instances to extend one's little finger elegantly'.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>A <span style='mso-field-code:
" HYPERLINK \0022woman\.htm\0022 "'><u><span style='color:blue'><a href="woman.htm">rapturous 
    woman</a></span></u></span> spreads out her arms--an acceptable display of 
    aesthetic 'sensibility', not vulgar personal feeling. Behind her the handsome 
    black servant, smiling, hovers with her cup, while her country-squire husband 
    yawns in the corner next to a fan-holding man- about-town. The scene looks 
    silly but harmless--yet it will prove just as fatal as the quack's chicanery. 
    The music and the fallen cards on one side of the room are balanced on the 
    other by the <span style='mso-field-code:
" HYPERLINK \0022cuckold\.htm\0022 "'><u><span style='color:blue'><a href="servant.htm">little 
    slave</a></span></u></span> in Moorish dress, who grins and points at the 
    antler horns of Actaeon, changed into a stag for watching Diana bathe naked. 
    Behind him the Countess's lover, the lawyer <span style='mso-field-code:" HYPERLINK \0022silvertongue\.htm\0022 "'><u><span
style='color:blue'><a href="servant.htm">Silvertongue</a></span></u></span>, gestures 
    eagerly towards the screen with its picture of a masquerade: the tickets are 
    already in his hands. </span></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Hogarth's wit 
    had never been so assured. Each scene had a different kind of humour. The 
    marriage contract, like the opening of a comedy of manners, introduced formal 
    contrasts of class; the bourgeois and the aristocrat conform to convention 
    - the <span style='mso-field-code:" HYPERLINK \0022\.\.\/marriage1\/dad\.htm\0022 "'><u><span
style='color:blue'><a href="../marriage1/dad.htm">Alderman</a></span></u></span>

style='color:blue'><a href="../marriage1/earl.htm">Earl</a></span></u></span> 
    lying back with a pseudo-Watteauesque grace. The morning scene, so acute and 
    penetrating in its psychological study of the young couple, damned both the 
    idle rich and the doom-demanding Methodist servant. The consulting room wove 
    the darkness of Jonson's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Alchemist</i> into a satire on modern doctors. The brilliant, billowing 
    lines of the morning levee blended the comedy of intrigue with a stab at 'effeminate' 
    artifice of culture. In these early scenes the dance of the eye is lilting, 
    but now the tempo changes. All along, the harmonies of Hogarth's painting 
    have included a sombre note, a hum of warning. Despite Fielding's praise of 
    his 'force of humour' Hogarth often tips towards tragedy. In stage comedy, 
    characters often overcome obstacles and find happiness; even in the plays 
    of Jonson or Molière, which end with the exposure and punishment of frauds, 
    the world is returned to some promise of order. But there is no happy resolution 
    for Moll Hackabout or Tom Rakewell, or for the new Earl and his Countess. 
    Instead, after an illusory whirl of excitement, they slide down a bleak declining 
    curve (379-381). </span></p>

    Plate 310). By 1735 Senesino had returned to his native Siena. Nichols, therefore, 
    believed the singer was meant to be Giovanni Carestini (1705-c. 1758), the 
    &quot;finest and deepest counter-tenor that has perhaps ever been heard&quot; 
    (C. Burney, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A General History of Music</i>,

    were of great social prominence (see Burney, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

ladies' calendars the longest days in the year are just those which are
followed by a night of dancing. Oh! those hours! So long, so long! It is as if
a stroke had paralysed the hands of the clock and time itself. There is no
dealing with the sun; night will not come! It is just such a day in this
picture; indeed the hours are even longer here, for there is to be not only a
ball, but—a Masked Ball! If therefore some remedy could not be devised, time
would not move at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><a href="lady.htm">Lady
Squanderfield</a> has accordingly summoned everything to her aid, so as to make
time feel the spur and compel it, if not to a fast trot, at least to the regulation
police walk which she herself adopts on days when the following night is to be
for sleep. One therefore rose this morning <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>numero
rotundo</i> at ten, breakfasted till about eleven, rushed afterwards in a
light, fetching dress to a saleroom to 'fetch' the dandies (here, the rumour
goes, time actually moved apace), wounded a few gentlemen, acquired a few modem
antiques which are strewn here on the floor, and so returned home. This brought
the hour hand quite considerably beyond its zenith through the descending
numerals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there are still three or
four hours until dinner, and for a healthy idler those are the most stubborn
and heavy-footed of the whole morning because, for someone with a good
digestion, dinner is said to have just such a prolonging effect upon time as
have ball nights upon the time of somebody who loves dancing. Lady
Squanderfield has a remedy for this, too. And what is it? It forms the content
of the fourth picture. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>She is holding her levee here, and in a style wherein are
tastefully combined the dignity of the Earl's wife and the familiarity and
condescension of the commoner. She accepts confidential morning visits in her
bedroom; like a lady she has her hair dressed, and like a duchess gives a
concert, small to be sure if one only counts the number of performers, but were
they to be weighed on the scales of art or those of the goldsmith, very great
and very costly. For to remark in passing, the singer is the famous eunuch, <a
href="castrato.htm">Carestini</a>, and the <a href="flute%20player.htm">flautist</a>
the renowned Weidermann, a German and a genuine man. It is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Privatissimum.</i> That is going to cost a
pretty penny! I refer here to the housekeeping book and the pious expression of
the righteous steward in the second Plate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The lady herself sits by the unveiled mirror, under the
hands of her <a href="hairdresser.htm">hairdresser</a>, robed in a
powder-mantle for the chaste draping of—the chair-back. Of the inner strife
which we noticed on her brow in the first picture there is no longer any trace.
In addition, all the rust of the city seems to have been polished off, and all
the awkwardness which stuck to her from boarding-school has been cultivated
away. We notice rather, and not without pleasure, a certain ease in her person,
evidently a consequence of pleasing visions from the past or of the future. Oh!
if only domestic happiness, and especially the event of which we see a very
telling symbol hanging from the chair-back, had a greater part in it! It is a
silver rattle with a teething coral which is hanging there; the lady is a
mother! But alas! alas! not a trace of motherly feelings; all capacity for that
has long been—cultivated away! If we try to imagine the source of the
contentedness in that little sugar-face, we could hardly avoid pulling a long
face—like the steward. Of the duet which is proceeding over there from
Weidermann's flute and Carestini's little golden mouth, she hears nothing, or
almost nothing. She listens simply and solely to the enchanting solo of her beloved
lawyer, <a href="silvertongue.htm">Silvertongue</a>, who there in her own
bedroom is lolling on the sofa opposite her, with oriental, effeminate
indolence, as if in a harem. In his right hand he holds a ticket for today's
Masked Ball, which he offers or actually hands to the lady.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What Mr Silvertongue is discussing here is a proposal that
they should meet that evening, if possible, at the masquerade. This is
sufficiently apparent from the lawyer's pointing to the Spanish screen where a
fancy dress ball is depicted; but it acquires certainty from the fifth picture
where we shall find that they have in fact met at a Masked Ball. It looks as if
he were pointing particularly at a nun who in the foreground there is
confessing to a monk, and as if he were recommending that disguise to the lady
for their common devotions that evening. They were to be monk and nun. This is
a very natural conjecture which should not be entirely disregarded, but it does
not seem to me justified. The main indication would have to be by mouth; with
the hand it could only be imperfectly made, especially considering the
direction in which the Countess is looking. The pointing gesture is rather
vague. In the picture which follows we shall see some of the ball costumes. And
there the lady's costume bears as little re- semblance to a nun's as she
herself to a saint. Trivial though this pointing gesture may appear here, it
will prove important enough for poor Silver-tongue; it implicates, in fact,
nothing less than a nail for his—gallows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>By his feet lies a book with the title <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sofa.</i> I do not know of a single .<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>interpreter who mentions this detail with
one word, and yet we may readily suppose that such a subtle and cunning man as
Hogarth would never have taken the trouble to draw even a plain book, let alone
one with that title, without some meaning and purpose. Now, the meaning is not
hard to find; it has even a double one. The book is in fact the infamous,
hot-blooded product of the pen of the younger Crébillon, entitled <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Le Sopha; conte morale,</i> and is just as
suitable for a lady's library as gilded oak-apples or candied night-shade
berries for a Christmas tree. The touch is thus highly characteristic and
surpasses even the finest touches which our artist has brought into this
picture for the same purpose. The Countess is an abandoned creature. This seems
to be the chief meaning and one which the whole character of the Plate
unmistakably confirms. But, apart from all this, there is a secondary, a more
comic meaning, which lies some- what deeper, and which Hogarth, who must have
known the book, un-doubtedly intends to indicate. It is as much justified by
the character of our artist's genius, as the first meaning by the character of
the whole picture. Crébillon's fairy story is based upon the following plot:
Almazéï, a sort of courtier at the Court of the Shah Baham, who was once as a
punishment transformed into a sofa, related afterwards what he saw and heard in
this guise, and a sofa, as we know, may well see and hear a thing or two in this
world. There were certain conditions for his transformation and restoration—he
was free to choose any shape, any material, any colour, any border, any
embroidery, that he fancied; he might serve whomsoever he pleased, but he must
remain a sofa until he happened to be present at an event which, of course, in
the higher regions of society may be as frequent as the great conjunction of
all the planets in the region of the sky—namely, innocence to innocence
mutually lost. It is upon this Almazéï that the lawyer here reclines, and upon
which the Countess has this morning placed her Crébillon. Oh! shuffle away,
poor Almazéï, on your four legs; in this house there is no redemption for you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind the lady whose silken lap, as we forgot to mention,
appears to serve here as an ornamental case for her watch, especially if viewed
from the sofa, stands the hairdresser. He is evidently of that country from
which the English, at least the higher strata, have long drawn their servants,
in order to have their hair dressed and their stomachs spoilt--coiffeurs and
cooks, that is. They provide decoration and indigestion— of the stomach, I must
expressly state, for to summon them or their recipes, to induce an indigestion
of the head, is a new custom. In fine, the creature is a Frenchman. Hogarth's
engravings, as our readers will have discovered by now, have their own symbols
for Frenchmen, just as the calendar for the quarters of the moon. For every
landmark in their path, which they travel or dance or crawl over the British horizon,
they have their special symbol. This fellow here is still one of the hollow,
hungry ones; he is still developing. He is seen here occupied with a pyrometric
experiment; he breathes upon the curling tongs and listens to the voice of the
advocate and in addition gapes at the—chairback. To do only one thing at a time
is impossible for such a fellow. Despite his expression —<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>un mouton qui rêve</i>—one can wager that he already knows more about
the Masked Ball and its implications than all the rest of the company.
Something might come of that observation, provided he makes use of it in the
proper quarters. This leads in a most natural way to a little remark about
barbers and hairdressers. It is incredible for what great purposes Nature
employs these otherwise unimportant creatures. Just as some insects carry
fertilizing pollen to flower cups, which without that service would have
remained sterile, so these people carry little family anecdotes from ear to
ear, to induce a love of humanity which without these intermediaries would
never have arisen. Or perhaps more appropriate: just as certain birds carry
undigested seed-grains to inaccessible heights for the promotion of physical
vegetation, so do these people, for the pro- motion of a certain kind of moral
purpose, carry many a little anecdote- grain from the lowest quarters of the
town into its higher regions. There really is a resemblance, and the whole
difference lies in the trivial dissimilarity between the organs with which each
deposits the undigested matter with the authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On the extreme left, richly decked and adorned with
British gold, British diamonds and British fat, negligently draping an arm over
the neighbouring chair, sits the eunuch, Carestini, said to be one of the
loveliest little pipes which the knife of song has ever cut out of Italian
cane. But just look at him now! Merciful Heavens! What an abominable bag-pipe
does the masterpiece of creation become when Art presumes to carve a flute out
of him. The tallowy lower jaw has neither beard nor force. The stiff cravat
with its glittering diamond cross, the holy cross of the most unholy, are only
a miserable substitute for that defect. The little mouth obtains thereby a
certain pappy, sloppy insignificance, and if it rouses any feeling whatsoever in
a grown-up person, it can only be the desire to hit it. How the fat has driven
all form and elasticity out of those thick knees, and the whole leg-piece!
Looking at those weak, wobbling lumps of legs,' we might take them for the wind
bag of a bagpipe, which has just devoted a good deal of its content to a trill
of the first water. Oh! if congenital neutrality in sex, though still in
possession of its weapons, is said, as I have heard, to plane away the most
important characteristics of the human face and human behaviour, in the eyes of
knowledgeable men and women, what in the world can a creature unarmed, or even
deprived of its arms, produce but such an abomination of bag growling. An
unlovely work of art, to be sure, but valuable all the same. The sleeves and
hem of his garment are heavily encrusted with gold thread, while diamonds
glitter on each finger joint, on knee- and shoe-buckles and on his ear. Merely
to achieve a setting for his voice, he has done everything possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind him stands our countryman, Weidermann, the famous
virtuoso on the German flute. If I am not much mistaken, there lurks in the
comer of his right eye, as well as at the corner of his mouth, a sort of
good-natured roguery which, taken together with his hawk nose, speaks in favour
of his honesty. He seems to smile in the very act of playing. In a company
where every face and every gesture is so rich in the ridiculous, it is
difficult to say what he is smiling at, if we assume that he has in fact looked
beyond the music. But Herr Weidermann's honour as a virtuoso compels us here to
assume that he has never taken his eyes off it. In that case, however, nothing
would remain to explain the smile except a private estimate of the costs of
their respective instruments. 'How much money did I give for my flute, and what
did the eunuch pay in cash value for his pipe?' There is no neutrality in
Weidermann's expression. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to the fattened Italian capon sits the <a
href="man.htm">English domestic cock</a>, desiccated in service; in their extremes
of physique, one worth as little as the other. There have been many
interpretations of that figure. Someone has even made a Prussian Ambassador
Michel out of it. Of course, many a Michel in this world may have looked like
that, and may look like it in the future, but, according to all the rules of
interpretation, this is certainly our hero, the Earl Squanderfield.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Hogarth himself were to reject this
interpretation, he would have only himself to blame for being misunderstood. Of
course, his Lordship appears thinner here than before, and what is still
queerer, thinner than later that evening. But what does it matter? The dandy
may have risen this morning but he is certainly not yet roused. He is still
only a caterpillar. His head is already in the chrysalis state— the rest will
follow, and before the dinner bell sounds the butterfly will appear in all its
glory. These are only trivialities; after all, hips are neither here nor there.
Since clothes have come to make the man. Nature has lost much of its custom. It
is certainly a little malicious of our artist to serve up this half-transparent
kipper together with the fattened Italian carp, as if on one dish. For really
the legs of his Lordship are by no means the straws which they seem to a
superficial observer. One need only cover over the two bamboo posts of the
Italian, whose propinquity is obviously harmful to his Lordship's, to see that
the latter are still a pair of legs upon which a man of some standing, who
neither stands nor walks very much, may still stand and walk quite passably.
But what has Hogarth done? With unpardonable malice, he has intentionally
covered over more than half of his Lordship's left leg with the left leg of the
Italian. Is that right? Indeed, if to cover over shortcomings in this way is
not worse than to discover them, then I do not know the meaning of cover and
discover. By this method, of course, one could in a moment turn the stoutest
walking-stick of the most up-to-date Parisian dandy, or even of Hercules
himself, into a mere matchstick. Thus the whole argument against identifying
the former and future Squanderfield with this creature here, which is based
upon the feeble legs of the subject, itself stands upon very weak legs.
Besides, for an artist of Hogarth's vitality and wit, it would be harder than
for others not to exaggerate the contrast once he had hit upon the idea. Oh!
the best-trained wit, ridden by Reason itself, may run away with its rider once
such artistic jumps are made. Then one usually tells only half the truth, or
else six quarters of it, which, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutatis
mutandis,</i> comes to very much the same thing. But now let us listen to the
other side of the argument: it must be Earl Squanderfield, for, in the first
place, he sits there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>en papillotes,</i>
just as his love, or rather his semi-wife, sits over there, not with her
husband but merely with her lover. He is waiting for the curling tongs of the
Frenchman whom they both employ. Nobody but a husband has the right to have
himself nipped in that way at a lady's levee. Thus they belong together
serviliter at least; they are married <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>à
la mode.</i> Secondly, just look at the head: is not that a horned animal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tout enticer?</i> And who in the wide world
could fail to see it? Even the little <a href="cuckold.htm">black boy</a> there
in the right-hand corner notices it and points with his finger at the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>papillotes</i> of a miniature Acteon which
has just arrived from the auction. Yes, indeed brother Acteon with his
ten-branched antlers even seems to point with his stump of an arm at the member
of his Order, Squanderfield, who has seven branches: ‘Just look, isn't that one
of ours too?' And the poor devil of a Lord really seems to have just recognized
his little brother. Oh he already feels a pinch in some part of his being! For
who would sip chocolate even the hottest, like that, if he were not burning
somewhere else as well? At present, his eye probably sees as little as his ear
hears or his tongue tastes; it is spiritual food which he consumes or tries to
digest perhaps a few paper sandwiches from his steward, and something of the
amorous collation to which Almazéï is listening over there. He surely is the
husband—<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> à la mode.</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                         </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Thirdly, what speaks very strongly in favour of this
interpretation is the expression, and even the attire, especially if one
compares it with the Squanderfield of the second Plate. He loves fancy coats.
Even at the scene of the catastrophe in the fifth Plate, he wears one of these,
whose cut is however different from that in the <a
href="../marriage2/mmm2small.htm">second Plate</a>. But, one might object, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bon-ton</i> plaster behind the ear is
missing. Answer: that is what happens to plasters in the night, and behind the
ear there really is something discernible which might well have deserved a one
inch <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bon-ton</i> plaster It is also the
first time that our hero has favoured us with his right ear- it was always the
left that we saw. That an evil which is usually symmetrical should have thus
broken the rule for once would, in this household at least (with the exception
perhaps of the mantelpiece ornaments in the second Plate), be precisely in
order. A stronger objection is one which I have raised myself: this gentleman
has, if else I see aright, a hat with a cockade under his arm, which, according
to English custom, would be an officer's hat. His Lordship is not an officer,
to be sure, but how if last night his Lordship has perhaps acted the officer,
and has only just returned home, as the other day, or that in the confusion he
has made an acquisition just as he did before? My readers may take their choice
here, if they find it worth their while. Perhaps their choice will be made
easier by the consideration that our hero might also have been brought into
such close contact with the Italian to demonstrate that if in this world a man
wished to acquire a sort of eunuch-credit for all kinds of courage and bravery,
he need not always use precisely the knife. </p>

somewhat beyond the equinox of life, in the direction of winter, is a certain
Mrs Lane, and the slumbering fox-hunter in the background, with the black wig
and the black cravat, is Mr Lane, her husband. He was such a passionate
adherent of that kind of hunting that he was nicknamed 'Fox-Lane'. After his
decease, the simple Mrs Lane became the complex Lady Bingley. Thus, my dearest
lady readers, you who are beyond the equinox of life in the direction of
winter, and still walk without a companion, for God's sake, don't despair too
soon! In our clime, at least, the sun of your luck behaves sometimes, even if
not always, like the Queen of Days which bears its name (Sunday). It presents
the Spring of life, and even its Summer, with tit-bits rather than solid,
lasting nourishment. Only in Autumn ripens the drink of the gods which delights
the heart of man. This is the season of the kingly Bergamote, the refreshing St
Germain, of the greasy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Poire de Beurrée

winter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

half-man in the physiological sense, but also at the half-man in the military
sense, probably more to evade the melodious stream issuing from that
contemptible orifice than perhaps to seek the source itself. She is delighted;
she is enraptured. The way she throws out her arms conveys to the eye what the
ear necessarily misses—the cadenza to which Carestini's song is approaching, if
he has not reached it already; just as the attitude of the whole Madame in
corpore illustrates its ravishing beauty. If the cadenza does not come to an
end soon, then indeed the cadence of the scale may become for Madame a cadence
from the chair. How very differently her husband behaves behind there, if
sleeping can be called behaving. Not a trace of resemblance, apart from the
trivial circumstance that he, too, is as if carried away, and is not quite
secure against a cadence from the chair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But was it perhaps our artist's intention to insinuate something here to
our eye which escapes our ear—that this concert is in fact a trio in which Mr
Lane plays the third instrument, I mean an accompaniment on nasal reedstops? He
seems at least to have the instrument tuned and set in position, and to judge
from his strong and healthy chest, the requisite bellows will be in pretty good
condition. How peacefully he sleeps! But oh! how he would start up if the
Tally-ho! suddenly sounded, or if some English bass eunuch tuned up his 'the
echoing hom calls the sportsmen abroad', etc., or even if instead of Carestini
and Weidermann, Malampus gave tongue accompanied by Lalaps, Okydromus,
Pamphagus and Hylaktor. Then, maybe, Madame would go to sleep. Is this, too, a

the unfeeling fox-hunter we notice, alas! as the eternal contrast to all wild
hunting and shooting, the most sugary sentimentality of behaviour, and the
extreme expression in masculine shape of affected delight. What a little balsam
box it is compared with the tarpot behind there! What a pity that the little
plaster on the lower lip, greatly though it heightens the charm of that dainty
face, somewhat disturbs the effect of the appreciative smirk. Without it we
might have learnt much better from his very lips what is, of course,
demonstrated more or less by the fop's whole behaviour; that is, how to give
expression to the ineffable. In order to indulge his ear in the highest degree,
he denies his palate the chocolate and, probably, since he turns his back so
care- fully on the man with the riding crop, deprives his nose also of part of
the stable perfume which may emanate thence. Although the loud exclamation of
wonder is necessarily missing, the five exclamation marks which he embodies
with the fingers of his left hand unmistakably denote its silent presence. From
the same hand, opened like a fan, hangs the folded fan of the lady herself. He
has apparently taken it into custody in order to have it redeemed in the end by
a kiss. That is how everything hangs together m this little man. Just add the
age in the sixties, a parrot-green coat with rose-coloured lining, and a pair
of shoes with red heels, and the future natural historian of the affections in
the male of the species will have just about the complete characteristics of an
old coxcomb. </p>

enraptured of Carestini, and not the more realistic adorer of <a

stares out at us, which, of course, is not exactly the most beautiful, but
certainly one of the most characteristic in the whole gathering. It is the head
of the <a href="servant.htm">negro</a> who is serving the chocolate into the
blue. Truly with the three diamonds in his face, of which the one upon his nose
is not genuine, but merely borrowed from the window, he puts in the shade,
completely and absolutely, all the diamonds worn by the eunuch in ear and
solitaire. Isn't that expressive language? And wasn't it clever to give more
prominence to the symbol of the new moon which the African there carries on his
shoulders than to the Italian full moon? If one tried to draw a little night
piece like that one would soon find out. There is no affectation in it; it is
pure, solid, human-animal instinct which draws the axis of his eyes so firmly
towards the Italian. Probably it is not so much the voice of the singer which
fascinates him, but the gestures which accompany it and the orifice from which
it oozes out. He laughs about the little pap-and-rag mouth which once washed
itself in the soft and feminine Tiber, and himself reveals a mouth that has
been rinsed in the Niger or the Senegal, and one of such dimensions that
neither the Senegal nor the Niger nor any other famous river god would need to
fear complaints about shortage, if he were to let his store, which had poured
hitherto from his urn, spout in future from such a head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We have already heard that the Countess was at an auction
this morning. Here we see from the auction catalogue which lies on the floor to
the right that some collection was put up for sale and the name of the owner;
it follows from the kind of articles bought there, and which we see standing
around here, that it was a collection of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objets
d'art.</i> The English title of the inventory is: 'A catalogue of the entire
collection of the late Sir Timothy Babyhouse, to be sold by auction.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>All the junk which her Ladyship bought there belongs, we
observe, to the class of antiques which we saw on the mantelpiece in the <a
href="../marriage2/tackyart.htm">second Plate</a>. The articles are so arranged
that the whole resembles a procession in which the members become more
important the farther back they are. It is reminiscent of a triumphal
procession. In front there trots on its four feet an unknown little animal
which seems to have precedence only because of its unimportance; behind it
crawl a couple without feet, next to it a little bowl, then an atrocious cat's
head, a few enchanted princesses together with the magician, then a horrible
pottery monster in the form of a candle-holder; now, more important, a butter
dish, and still more important, a mystic pot with a mystic seven upon it, and,
finally, most important of all, the Imperator Acteon himself with the crown of
victory upon his head. He leans against a wash-basin of majolica ware
hand-painted by Giulio Romano, a great rarity. Raphael-like rubbish of this
sort is to be found everywhere; the picture itself represents a nude woman
being bitten by a wicked goose. The rear is brought up by a magnificent vase of
the pot-pourri type. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Still more mystical perhaps than the seven on the little
pot may be the round figure of 100 upon Acteon's belly, but this we shall leave
an open question. In the counting-house of her Ladyship's father, such round
numbers could have been seen on more important slips of paper. One of the
figures is marked with the number four. Her Ladyship has thus attended the
auction from the beginning, and held out till Lot 100—a very long time if it
all took place the same morning. But there was a little statue to be bought for
her lord and master, to hang his hat on in the evening. Thus the series of
little nonsensical objects there on the floor becomes in the end very
significant for our story. It is irrefutable evidence of crude lack of taste,
coarse sensuality, and what is ultimately not much better (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>videatur</i> the steward) of thriftlessness in buying, for want of a
better occupation. What may she have paid for that doll with the horns? To form
an opinion we should have to imagine another such creature being present at the
same auction, or several more of them, each just as extravagant, wise, and well
brought up as Madame. We must imagine, too, the noble contempt of money and the
elevated feelings which so easily overpower ladies' souls in that sort of sales
excitement, especially if their absent husbands are perhaps engaged with equal
ardour in some similar glory-, rank-, or title-auction. Then one should only
hear how those ladies, as if in vocal contest, now with alternating voices, now
with simultaneous duet and trio, drive one another higher and higher and, like
jealous nightingales, continue to warble till first one, then the other, worn
out at last, falls down from the branch. Then what? Oh, the doll was not worth
three farthings, but the joke of buying a man with horns in the presence of so
many gentlemen and ladies, and the pleasure of seeing the nightingales fall,
one after another. . . For a satisfaction like that, as many golden sovereigns
would be but a trifle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Our artist has perhaps exaggerated a little here. Who in
the world, many a lady might ask, would buy such jokes, and moreover such moral
filth? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fi donc!</i> Quite right. But how
if we were to translate the numbers here into book titles, and in this way
transform the whole collection into a modem lady's library? How's that to de
done? Even supposing the little dishes and bowls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>might </i>signify a cookery book or a recipe for making candles or
boiling soap, this does not imply that they must have that meaning. Could they
not just as well be instructions for face-tanning, for the improvement of the
hair roots, and for painting a pink and white com- plexion? And if even the
enchanted princesses, the dwarf, the gander on the dish, and, finally, the
homed creature with the one and two noughts on his belly, were transformed into
books, would the library look a jot more respectable than the floor does here?
Hardly, hardly. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The little procession becomes almost comic if we consider
that it is making straight for Carestini, and if we then recall Orpheus—and why
not recall him here? If Orpheus with his harp made oak trees and granite
boulders approach him in a waltz, why should not Carestini with his pipe entice
that Nurnberg ware? Either the one is not a true story, or the other is at
least possible. To return to the idea of translation into book titles, the
small, dainty animal which is trotting on its little feet at the head of the
procession, just because it trots on little feet and is so dainty, would have
to be a poetry almanack and, by the same token, its two legless, prosaic
companions could be nothing else but a couple of prose almanacks (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Taschenkalenders</i>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Close to
Carestini's chair lie <a href="cards.htm">visiting and invitation cards</a>, trump
upon trump. Some turn upwards their acquired inscribed aspect, others their
congenital printed one; still others show nothing, just as they happen to have
fallen. We shall briefly review them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Lady Squander (so she is called on all these cards, instead
of Squanderfield, perhaps because most of the fields are already squandered) is
invited : (1) to Lady Townley's Drum (this is a sort of party where they gamble
and talk nineteen to the dozen), and that is for next Monday. On the card
stands Munday instead of Monday, a telling indication of her Ladyship's
learning. (2) To Lady Heathen's Drum-major, where everything is more spacious
and magnificent, gambling as well as tongue-wagging, and that is for Sunday
next. Pious John Bull does not forgive a soul for playing and making music on
Sundays, that is why the Sabbath breaker is called here Lady Heathen. But so
far as I know, the Jew's harp of tongue-wagging, which is played at all
parties, is as little forbidden on Sundays in England as it is with us. (3) To
Miss Hairbrain's Rout (also a sort of party which, if it is what its name says,
must be like a small riot). Finally, there lies with them No. (4), the card
upon which a foreign Count Basset inquires after the health of her Ladyship. He
has apparently gone to England to learn English, and here gives a proof of his
proficiency, for which reason we quote it in full: 'Count Basset begs to no how
Lade Squander sleapt last nite.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>By the pictures on the walls, our artist continues to
throw more and more into relief his conception of the ladies' master-passion.
He started with the Primer for Young Women over there on the sofa; below in the
basket he continued his tale, and on the walls we now see the sequel. There are
four pictures. We must be brief. On the right hangs the <a href="pic1.htm">'Consequences
of Intoxication'</a>, a few rungs above the middle stage, in the story of Noah
and his daughters. The explanation of the dish picture was taken from a daily
paper which like a falling leaf (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fliegendes
Blatt</i>) has long since flown away. The explanation of the present picture
(the biblical), however, we should have to copy from leaves which are anything
but flying, and which it is hoped may therefore never fly away this side of the
Rhine, wherefore we refer the reader to them. Next to this picture hangs the
'Consequences <a href="pic2.htm">of Masquerades'</a>, in the story of the
beautiful princess lo, where she, too, is bitten by the enraged Jupiter clad in
his usual Thundercloud-domino. This is a copy of a very well-known presentation
of that biting by Michelangelo Buonarroti, bought of course by her Ladyship for
the original itself, and perhaps even paid for I as such. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>To the left hangs
<a href="pic3.htm">Jupiter</a> for the third time, again en masque, for we must
confess that the gander on the dish over there was this same Jupiter. Pictures
like that might induce anybody to try his luck for once at a Masked Ball,
especially if he is a friend of Lady Heathen's. Jupiter appears this time in
the guise of an eagle carrying his Ganymede to Olympus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is queer is that the King of the Gods is
about to bite again here. It almost makes us afraid to look. Oh, if only
Ganymede would do the riding this time; I mean if only he would be, as the
French so excellently put it, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>un cheval
sur un aigle! </i>As he is now hanging from the eagle, this will not come to a
good end. I tremble, I tremble! Jupiter who hovers there just above Carestini's
head is listening to the divine voice of that mortal; 'I must have such a
singer, too,' he thinks, and no sooner thought than done, proceeds immediately
with his own noble beak to the operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Above that picture,
in Olympus itself and among the Immortals, there hangs, somewhat ominously, a <a
href="silvertonguepic.htm">portrait of Mr Silvertongue</a>, quite undisguised,
in all the exterior dignity appropriate to a Head of the House. At his feet
there the horned animal felled by him gnaws at its chain. Good! We shall leave
it at that. In the next two Plates we shall see both the hanging and the
felling in more solid form. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Silvertongue's picture was hung just opposite the sofa for
the sole purpose of promoting devotion. As soon as that ceases, he receives, as
we shall hear, a different place, or rather, as soon as that idol obtains another
place, the devotion ceases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>A trifle to finish with, for surely every puzzle is a
trifle. On the canopy of the lady's bed the artist has put a French lily. Now
how in the world do the French arms come to be on an English bed? (114-128)</p>
