<a href="../marriage1/mmm1small.htm">Plate I</a> are more overt in Plate II.
Austin Dobson delicately reports that the <a href="slump.htm">Viscount</a> has
returned from his &quot;independent nocturnal expedition&quot; (74). Cowley
adds that, unlike the <a href="../../Rake/rake3/drunktom.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Rakewell'</span></a><span class=SpellE>s</span> drunkenness with
an undercurrent of sexual exhaustion, <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield's</span>
pose indicates, &quot;sexual exhaustion with only undercurrents of drunkenness
and brawling&quot; (58). These minor distinctions aside, it is clear that his
lover's cap is visible in his pocket, and his <a href="sword.htm">sword</a>
lies broken on the floor in what Cowley calls an emblem of &quot;inadequacy or
impotence&quot; (59).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A <a href="dog.htm">dog</a>,
frequently an indicator of sexuality and sexual arousal in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The <a href="slump.htm">wife</a>
has been the source of more debate. <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> notes
that her occupation has been &quot;much more innocent and middle-class than <span
class=GramE>his</span> debauchery&quot; (52). The overturned <a href="cards.htm">card
table</a> confirms this observation. There is even a note of sympathy with the
wife who &quot;vainly attempts to win her husband's attention by her glance and
outstretched foot&quot; (<span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> 52). Cowley
confirms that she &quot;teases her exhausted husband with her sensuality&quot;
(75). Her failed attempts implicate him as the first to break their vows and
somewhat vindicate her as she tries, at least at first, to make the marriage
work. This action, coupled with her <a href="../marriage1/ladys.htm">lack of
interest in <span class=SpellE>Silvertongue</span> apparent in the first plate</a>,
mediates her blame for the impending downfall. Lichtenberg's commentary on the
scene is torn: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Her
demeanor can also be interpreted as sexual exhaustion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While she appears adequately covered for
modern audiences, Cowley observes that eighteenth-century viewers would have
found her “shameless for appearing before the servants with her lacings
uncovered, her knees apart, and without her hoops” (60).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her pose also inspires commentary.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paulson calls it a “vulgar stretch” (<i

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Signs of
marital breakdown are abundant in the scene. The broken sword is one such
indication. Another is the <a href="tackyart.htm">painting</a> over the
fireplace of Cupid vainly playing his bagpipes amidst the ruins. Paulson notes
that this, along with the bust's broken nose (indicative of sexual problems)
and &quot;the candles burnt down to their sockets . . <span class=GramE>.are</span>
all emblems of a marriage out of harmony&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Graphic </i>270).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawrence Stone
relates that extramarital affairs among the aristocracy were
&quot;expected&quot; if not morally sanctioned, and <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
explores the consequences of this expectation as Lady <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>
is driven perhaps by her husband's neglect, perhaps by societal permissiveness
into the bed other waiting lover (330-331). Certainly she apes the actions
other husband; the plate showing her indiscretions follows that which detail
his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>No
commentator has implicated the wife in anything more than participating in an
all-night party and the seduction of her unwilling husband.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the hints of her
already-accomplished infidelity are present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The covered pornographic painting, which, as Cowley notes, may symbolize
<span class=GramE>an adultery</span> “not yet fully realized” (76) may point to
the wife’s disloyalty as well as that of her husband.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paralleling of Plates <a

of the pair’s separate pleasures supports this reading.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the <a href="chair.htm">overturned
chair</a> implies a hasty retreat, the pointing instrument case acting perhaps
as an indicator of the direction of the lover’s (<span class=SpellE>Silvertongue’s</span>)
departure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wife’s seductive pose
recalls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Harlot’s Progress </i>and <a
href="../../harlot/19/harlot.htm">Moll’s attempt to seduce the merchant</a> to
divert his attention away from her escaping lover.<span

      his pocket. Only one receipt, marked '1743', is stuck on his spike, but 
      he grasps a sheaf of unpaid bills. </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in' align="left">Few would be surprised 
      by this scene. Six years later, Horace Walpole noted: </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in' align="left">'Lord Coke has demolished 
      himself very fast; I mean his character; you know he was married but last 
      spring; he is always drunk, he lost immense sums at play, and seldom goes

      her will.'</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal align="left">The society that accepted contractual marriages 
      also accepted their consequences. Since the Restoration, aristocratic husbands 
      had assumed a natural right to have mistresses, making no secret either 
      of their <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amours</i> or their bastards. And although 
      female chastity-- for reasons of property, not propriety--was considered 
      imperative until an heir was born, after that high-born women soon claimed 
      equal rights. Succeeding generations of earnest bourgeoisie were shocked 
      to think this <span class=SpellE>élite</span> culture of adultery might 
      spread downwards, becoming the fashion of the town for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>women</i> as much as for men. However much Pope might say that 'every 
      woman is at heart a rake', nothing could be further from the ideal of the 
      middle classes, as expressed by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Letter 
      of Genteel and Moral Advice</i>, which went through eight editions between 
      1740 and 1766: </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in' align="left">'There is great

style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span></span></b>The <a
href="../marriage1/earl.htm">old Earl</a>, it seems, is already disintegrated
and gathered to the bosom of William the Conqueror! Neither the <a
href="slump.htm">son</a> nor the <a href="stretch.htm">daughter-in-law</a> whom
we see sitting here appears to be specially moved by the fact that Death has
won at last his eighty-year-old lawsuit against the old gentleman. They, too,
are contending here, not with Death, but with his half-brother, Sleep, and as
one sees, with rather unequal success. She, certainly, is fast losing her case,
and he, since his own ill-<span class=SpellE>humour</span> is taking his part,
will certainly win his. They have both slept little or not at all last night;
she, in this house here, and he in another, perhaps a mile distant. The course
of the story is as follows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It is still early morning here, the clock on the wall may
show what time it will; they are still yawning, still stretching themselves,
and still break- fasting. Whether this is right or not is none of the plebeian
sun's business. It is, of course, a somewhat topsy-turvy state of affairs, but
then so are the fishes up there in the trees. It is the custom in this
household and it cannot be helped. The young <span class=GramE>gentleman</span>
who, by the way, has aged over-night through rather heavy debauchery, seems to
have just flung himself down in here after being unloaded from his carriage.
Obviously, he has stumbled over the chair with the fine <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>Cremona</span></st1:place></st1:City> violins, has fallen and <a
href="sword.htm">broken his sword</a>. The figure is a masterpiece, and
undoubtedly one of the best <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has ever done. It
is a true picture of impotence after the wildest debauchery of every kind.
Nothing holds together in him through inner force. His position has been
reached through force of gravity, through mechanical reaction, and, passively,
through the shape of the chair. Waistcoat and stockings hang upon him just like
his hat and his hair. The hair-bag is gone, the watch is gone and the money is
gone. In place of money there are now only empty hands which search for it and
find nothing but a melancholy support for themselves, and for the long heavy
arms which have become limp as leather through sleeplessness and excesses. What
has suffered least in the tumult is the black seal of the Faculty behind the
ear. On what does his gaze rest? Outwards it certainly reaches no farther than
half-way towards the overturned chair; inwards it must look uncommonly deep on
this mom of domestic peace. Even through the mists of headache which hover
round his brow it is still possible to recognize some traces of deeper
heartache. This is what happens to little fishes once an over-frivolous jump
has thrown them too far out of their element. Intoxication, which, at its onset
and during its progress, raises the drinker above his usual state of mind and
heart, lowers him again at its expiration below that state, so that in every
kind of mood he can usually find some rung on this ladder from which he can,
without much trouble, survey his whole being. He seems to calculate; but no, he
only feels in a dull sort of way what would happen if he attempted to
calculate. This is the ill-<span class=SpellE>humour</span> which, as we said,
takes the young gentleman's part against Sleep. However prostrate he may be
though, he has not left the battlefield wholly without booty. From his coat-pocket
there hangs an object of muslin and ribbon which only rarely, and never without
some great <span class=SpellE>unheaval</span>, finds its way into male
coat-pockets. It is some small perfumed head-gear which has been discovered by
the lady's lap-dog with its <span class=SpellE>Boulognaise</span> sagacity, and
at which it is sniffing with peace-loving cautiousness. Thus, what could hardly
be regarded as an adequate security for a mere hair-bag has now become,
apparently, the whole substitute for purse and watch! So much for the
activities of the young gentleman last night, of which the little dog here has
the scent—and now a word on the activities of the young lady, which the young
gentleman himself is scenting out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The whole night long she has entertained there in the
magnificent Egyptian drawing-room, a company of card-players, young gentlemen
and such-like, with a little tea, a little music, and a little dancing. They
have gambled long and wildly; the candles are burning low; they burn up the
daylight, as the saying goes, although it is a winter's day. One of the tables
has its <a href="cards.htm">cards</a> scattered on the ground; the <span
class=SpellE>Pandectae</span> of Whist, ‘<a href="hoyle.htm">Hoyle on Whist</a>’,
have been trampled underfoot, and perhaps that <a href="chair.htm">chair</a>
with its costly woodwork—the violins—was also thrown over during some turmoil
in this darkish corner. For apart from the glimmering light of the coal fire
and the rather distant glow of the candelabra, there was no special
illumination here, evidently with intention. At any rate the two candles near
the clock have not been lit. An excellent touch it seems to me! A few unlit
candles on each candelabra would have provided sufficient evidence of how
little the people here cared for enlightenment; that in addition we find the <span
class=SpellE>unburnt</span> candles near the clock shows how little they cared
for time either. Indeed, the proper time for the deeds of twilight as well as
of darkness can be found without any clock; or if one needed to use a clock, it
would be at a time when neither hands nor dial were visible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The young lady is thus very, very tired; she shows it by
certain gestures in which there is indeed very little breeding or, if there is
any at all it is very, very half-baked. She stretches a little, or, as they say
in some parts she threatens her spouse with the sign of the horns. She is
certainly healthy, perhaps too healthy. Even the sleepy expression is not
without force and indicates, like her whole attitude, a surplus of everything
in which her poor husband is so sadly lacking. It appears she has slept a
little, in the chair, and is soon going to sleep again if the conversation
between her and her beloved is to continue with the same vivacity with which it
began. What the little empty box or <span class=SpellE>étui</span> in her hand
signifies is not easy to say. If there were a little mirror in the lid then the
matter—and greatly to her credit—would not be difficult to decide. It would
obviously mean that on waking up she was fulfilling one of the primary
obligations, I mean the duty of self-examination; that her face has passed that
examination fairly well may then be clearly inferred from the placid stretching
which immediately followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>She has breakfast
in front other. It is, as one sees—and how could it be otherwise after such a
matrimonial night?—laid and meant for one. If only the lady were too! With such
a husband one might perhaps forgive her a night like the last. But with those
folds in her gown which no longer lie as they did on her wedding day, and
which, alas!, on account of the new shoot on William the Conqueror's family
tree <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> no longer lie like that— to
carry on with cards, violins, and <span class=SpellE>Pandectae</span> till the
early hours of the morning. Madam, that was really not nice, no matter how
fashionable <span class=GramE>The</span> gentleman, too, has just had his
breakfast. It must have tasted abominably, for the <a href="man.htm">old
steward</a> who had brought it in is carrying it away again completely
untouched. It consisted of a sheaf of bills which were due to be paid that
morning, and of which only one is receipted, and that is dated June 4th,
whereas now it is obviously winter. The paid one is signed and hangs on the
steward's file. It was, of course, a nasty bit to swallow, and yet these were
but little pieces of bread and butter compared with the loaf which he carries
under his arm—the ledger. That can hardly have been even sniffed at this
morning. To try to comment on the steward's head and the meaning of his
expression and the gesture of his hand in words would surely be the most
unforgivable misuse of alphabetic writing that could possibly be perpetrated.
This is not what printing type was meant for in the world. The most scrupulous
preparation of foot- notes, according to their two great divisions, would come
to grief with a text like this: not only those which expound in order to help
understanding, but also the much more learned ones whose aim is to hinder
understanding. If I <span class=GramE>were</span> to say, 'Look, that's how it
stands with his Lordship's finances', and pointed at that household god there,
would anybody still ask, 'but what is the real state of his Lordship's
finances?' Not a soul, to be sure— at least, not between <st1:place>Cape St
 Vincent</st1:place> and Nova <span class=SpellE>Zembla</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conversely, that head is meant to help us in
our interpretation of the rest, and we therefore count confidently in advance
upon our readers' indulgence if, perhaps, in some of the following passages,
nothing more is said by way of explanation but: <span class=SpellE><i

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But although the meaning of that face needs no words, the
man's history requires a few. The face is said to be the portrait of a certain
Edward Swallow, an old honest wine-steward of the then Archbishop of
Canterbury. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>, who was at that time in search
of a model for the steward's head, had long been minded to fix on that one, on
account of its honest simplicity. At last a friend of the Archbishop took <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> to <span class=SpellE>Lambeth</span>. There the
painter sketched him unobserved and as he re-entered his carriage he whispered
to his companion, 'Now I have him!' The square- toed shoes, the old-fashioned
coat, the uncurled hair, all indicate that the man does not belong to this
world, and least of all the world to which nine- tenths of the English servants
of such homes now belong. He appears to be a Methodist, at least that is what <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has made of him, perhaps out of mischievousness,
for out of his pocket peeps a book <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>On
Regeneration,</i> and, as is well known, the word regeneration is the permanent
pass-word of that spiritual Corps. Moreover, discussions on the subject form a
pious occupation in many of their gatherings, a sort of spiritual whist, and in
this way Hoyle and Whitfield come very well into the picture here together—<span

<span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Ireland sees in that figure, I am quite unable to
discover. It would have been easy enough for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
to find the appropriate physiognomy for such a character, and it is my firm
conviction that the old and therefore tried domestics of an Archbishop of
Canterbury will be surely the last class of humanity, not only in England but
perhaps in the world, where a painter would think of finding rogue
physiognomies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind there, in the temple of the aristocratic Bacchante,
among the candles which, as we remarked, are burning the daylight, there seems
to be one which has run its course and is in the act of setting fire to the
chair- back. It is really already alight. The matter could become serious. <span
class=GramE>But fortunately another chair-back, against which a servant has
dozed off while standing, becomes aware of the catastrophe, threatens to throw
off its rider, and in this way will probably be the saving of its brother.</span>

text-autospace:none'>The pictures in the drawing-room are not fearful and
sanguinary as those in the <a href="../marriage1/mmm1small.htm">betrothal room</a>;
on the contrary, they aim at pure, cold-blooded edification. Most of them
represent <a href="saints.htm">saints</a> with their haloes. Although it is not
possible to see the halo of the fourth on account of the lights in front, we
can assume its presence from the rest of the company and the uniform frames. <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
takes them to be the Four Evangelists. Now this is just what they are not. The
central figure of the three is evidently Saint Andrew with the cross of his
name, while the figure hanging on his right is a she-saint, perhaps a Madonna
with a chalice, and the fourth holds a sword in his hand. What use would a
sword be to an Evangelist? One does not write gospels with a sword in one's
fist; one only interprets them with it, and that is a more recent innovation.
The most sacred figure among them all appears to be the one of which the
curtain permits us to see only the little naked foot. What a pity! Had we come
earlier, when the young gentlemen were still here, we could have seen
everything. Oh! Madam, Madam! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

contrast in the pictures of the drawing-room, the moral principles of our young
couple, so he shows us now their aesthetic principles in the decoration of the
ante-room. This is a point which ought not to be overlooked, especially in
these Plates. For <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has, with great delicacy
and wherever he could, tried to expose the complete lack of feeling for beauty
and art in these two families, especially in the aristocratic one. It must have
been his intention to show how much better it would have been for this house
had the taste of its owner been a little better formed in his youth. It cannot
be denied that at least the blunders on a grand scale which are a source of
misfortune within the family and, according to the perpetrator's <span
class=SpellE>calibre</span>, for whole countries, proceed as a rule from people
who combine with great fortune or great power a complete lack of feeling for
beauty, except perhaps in women. </p>

Chinese gods, apparently in an advanced state of pregnancy, sit there naked so
that the folds of their garments should not come out of crease. Others have
their hands outstretched from their shoulders, wanting to make the sign of the
horns but unable to. Vases stiff as railings and little bottles dumpy as corks
alternate with curious objects of nature and with <span class=SpellE>artefacts</span>
such as chance will sometimes produce. Most ludicrous of all is an antique
bust. It is a pity that its head is new and the nose still newer than the head.
It must have been bought for a <span class=SpellE>Faustina</span>. On the whole
there reigns among this junk an admirable symmetry and the most meticulous
order. Every little bottle has its <span class=GramE>counter-bottle,</span> and
every freak its freak to match. This seems to be the most orderly spot in the
house. As one sees, they are quite capable of keeping order under that roof
when it suits them, and when it does not suit the object. The picture on the <span
class=SpellE>overmantle</span> represents a Cupid who has had a miserable fate,
or at least has it now. His temple has collapsed, his bow has no string and his
quiver no arrows; nothing remains for him but the bagpipes and the pipe upon
which he now fingers his monotonous lament. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>No matter how ridiculous the clock looks up there, with
its fishes in the trees and its cat among the fishes, it is possibly not only
the greatest work of art in the room, but even the greatest masterpiece of the
clockmaker's art. I believe, in fact, that we may conclude from the solemn
position of the cat, which seems to do nothing but just sit there idly, that
the clock is a cat-clock which <span class=SpellE>mee-ows</span> the hours just
as there are cuckoo-clocks which cuckoo them. A clock upon which a very finely
carved dog barks the hours has, as a friend of mine writes, been offered for
sale by an Englishman not long ago, and at a very high price. This gives not a
little support to my assumption. But Lord <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield's</span>
clock exceeds that one by far, especially if one considers that the quarters
might perhaps be <span class=SpellE>mee</span>-owed in a different tone, or
even by kittens. From what I hear, a pupil of Le <span class=SpellE>Drozl</span>
is said to be even now employed in constructing a clock on which a wild boar
grunts the hours in short snorts. Probably he had the idea from the celebrated
Pig Concert of the conductor <span class=SpellE>Pepusch</span> in <st1:State><st1:place>Berlin</st1:place></st1:State>,
in which the voices of the pigs were blown on bassoons as <span class=SpellE><i

belong on steeples. The two fishes look to me as if they too were stuck in a
wave which is connected with the clock. Who knows whether they may not make
their hourly carp-jump as well? It would be a delightful idea, and all the more
remarkable in that it takes place in the tree-tops—an event only rarely indeed
encountered in Nature (95-101).</p>
