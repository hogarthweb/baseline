    </b>The young <span
class=GramE>gentleman</span> who, by the way, has aged over-night through rather 
    heavy debauchery, seems to have just flung himself down in here after being 
    unloaded from his carriage. Obviously, he has stumbled over the chair with 
    the fine <st1:City><st1:place>Cremona</st1:place></st1:City> violins, has 
    fallen and <a href="sword.htm">broken his sword</a>. The figure is a masterpiece, 
    and undoubtedly one of the best Hogarth has ever done. It is a true picture 
    of impotence after the wildest debauchery of every kind. Nothing holds together 
    in him through inner force. His position has been reached through force of 
    gravity, through mechanical reaction, and, passively, through the shape of 
    the chair. Waistcoat and stockings hang upon him just like his hat and his 
    hair. The hair-bag is gone, the watch is gone and the money is gone. In place 
    of money there are now only empty hands which search for it and find nothing 
    but a melancholy support for themselves, and for the long heavy arms which 
    have become limp as leather through sleeplessness and excesses. What has suffered 
    least in the tumult is the black seal of the Faculty behind the ear. On what 
    does his gaze rest? Outwards it certainly reaches no farther than half-way 
    towards the overturned chair; inwards it must look uncommonly deep on this 
    mom of domestic peace. Even through the mists of headache which hover round 
    his brow it is still possible to recognize some traces of deeper heartache. 
    This is what happens to little fishes once an over-frivolous jump has thrown 
    them too far out of their element. Intoxication, which, at its onset and during 
    its progress, raises the drinker above his usual state of mind and heart, 
    lowers him again at its expiration below that state, so that in every kind 
    of mood he can usually find some rung on this ladder from which he can, without 
    much trouble, survey his whole being. He seems to calculate; but no, he only 
    feels in a dull sort of way what would happen if he attempted to calculate. 
    This is the ill-humour which, as we said, takes the young gentleman's part 
    against Sleep. However prostrate he may be though, he has not left the battlefield 
    wholly without booty. From his coat-pocket there hangs an object of muslin 
    and ribbon which only rarely, and never without some great unheaval, finds 
    its way into male coat-pockets. It is some small perfumed head-gear which 
    has been discovered by the lady's lap-dog with its Boulognaise sagacity, and 
    at which it is sniffing with peace-loving cautiousness. Thus, what could hardly 
    be regarded as an adequate security for a mere hair-bag has now become, apparently, 
    the whole substitute for purse and watch! So much for the activities of the 
    young gentleman last night, of which the little dog here has the scent&#8212;and 
    now a word on the activities of the young lady, which the young gentleman 
    himself is scenting out (95-96).. </p>
