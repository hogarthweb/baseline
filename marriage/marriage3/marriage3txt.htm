Lord Squanderfield's sexual tastes run toward the deviant. Here, <a
href="lord.htm">Squanderfield</a> visits a <a href="quack.htm">quack doctor</a>
with the current object of his affections, who appears to be a very <a
href="girl.htm">young girl</a>. Shesgreen notes that the placement of his
mistress is vulgarly &quot;between the nobleman's legs&quot; and that she seems
&quot;the victim of his decadent appetite for girl children&quot; (53).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His cane is vulgarly upraised, hinting at his
sexual arousal at procuring such a treasure. Both Shesgreen and Peter Quennell
remark that Squanderfield has certainly &quot;lost his appetite for normal
adult pleasures&quot; (Quennell 174).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The purpose of his visit is made clear by the prominent beauty patch on
his neck; his mistress's tears convey that she too has been infected. The
unnaturalness of their attraction is underscored by the unusual objects in the
room: Paulson notes that the <a href="skull.htm">skeleton</a> in the closet
behind Squanderfield is &quot;making amorous advances to a life-size
figure&quot; and Shesgreen draws attention to the &quot;two pictures of
abnormal human beings&quot; (53).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lichtenberg states, &quot;Next to the poison chest, Hogarth has
excellently . . . placed two mummies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Out of their infinite security . . . they look down, evidently with
proud contemptuous looks&quot; (112-113).</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their chronological distance recalls the
&quot;good old days&quot; when such corruption was not so commonplace. These
and the other <a href="memento.htm">objects of death</a> and dismemberment also
lend a grave and ominous air to the scene, as if these actions will have
eternal consequences. The <a href="woman.htm">other woman</a> pictured is of a
more obscure function. It has been alternately suggested that she is the young
girl's mother, her procuress, and even another mistress for Squanderfield. Her
disgust is evident, however, as both her glare and opened knife indicate.
Certainly this is to be our reaction as well, as Lichtenberg terms her the
&quot;Mother Superior&quot; (104) of the scene—a satirical move, but one that
places her, rather correctly, in the moral, as well as physical, center of the
work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    The marriage contract, like the opening of a comedy of manners, introduced

    - the <a href="../marriage1/dad.htm">Alderman stooping</a>, feet wide apart, 
    the <a

    The morning scene, so acute and penetrating in its psychological study of 
    the young couple, damned both the idle rich and the doom-demanding <a

    The machine in the left foreground holds two folios, one of which, open to 
    the title page reads: &quot;EXPLICATION DE DEUX MACHINES SUPERBES L'UN POUR 
    REMETTRE L'EPAULES L'AUTRE POUR SERVIR DE TIRE BOUCHON INVENTES PAR MONSR 
    DE LA PILLULEVUES ET APROUVEÈS PAR L'ACADEMIE ROYAL DES SCIENCES A PARIS&quot;; 
    in short, these elaborate machines are for straightening a dislocated limb 
    and drawing a cork from a bottle. Dr. Misaubin was called &quot;M. de la Pilule&quot; 
    for his famous pill. He has been identified as the lean doctor in the <a href="../../harlot/22/man2.htm">fifth 
    plate of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A Harlot's Progress</i></a>, a much leaner doctor than this one, whom 
    Hogarth may have wished to generalize.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Misaubin 
    died April 20, 1734, but was still remembered in 1749 when Fielding referred 
    to his conceit, which was so great that he &quot;used to say that the proper 
    direction to him was, 'To Dr. Misaubin, in the World' (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tom Jones</i>, Bk. XIII, <span class=GramE>Chap</span>. 
    2). The woman is said to have been modeled on Misaubin's Irish wife (J. T. 
    Smith, 2, 163). </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In one show case a large periwig and wig-block are visible, 
    probably Misaubin's, and a <a href="skull.htm">skeleton</a> making amorous 
    advances to a life-size anatomical figure. Trusler (pp. 76-77) thinks that 
    the bones are warning the flesh of the consequences of dealing with quacks. 
    Over the top hang a large glass urinal and a brass shaving-dish, and near 
    this is a narwhal tusk that, with its convolutions, resembles a striped barber's 
    pole. All of this is to intimate the quack's original calling as a barber-surgeon 
    (See Rouquet, p. 35.) A <a href="croc.htm">dried crocodile</a> with an ostrich's 
    egg depending from its belly hangs from the ceiling. There are also an enormous 
    femur, part of a fish's skeleton, an old tall hat, a pair of shoes and an 
    odd shoe, the head of a stuffed crocodile, a large prick spur and its straps, 
    a sword and buckler (suggesting Don Quixote or Hudibras), a stuffed fish and 
    a picture of a monstrous child. Resting on top of the case is a pile of pill-boxes, 
    a <a href="head.htm">model of a human head with a pill in its mouth</a> and 
    a movable jaw, reminiscent of Friar Bacon's brass head (in Greene's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friar 
    Bacon and Friar Bungay</i>); there is also a tripod, used for holding retorts, 
    but here resembling the triple gallows at Tybum. The position of the gallows, 
    directly over the anatomical model's head, implies that the latter is the 
    stuffed, dried body of a hanged malefactor. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The show case at the right is full of jars used at the time 
    in apothecaries' shops, and it has a stuffed animal head (probably a wolf) 
    on top Beyond this are two mummy cases and two pictures of full-length monsters, 
    one a two-headed hermaphrodite, the other an anthropophagi with his head beneath 
    his shoulders. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The meaning of the print is in general clear, but in particulars 
    open to disagreement. Dr. Misaubin is standing next to a <a
href="memento.htm">human skull</a>, “the forehead of which has been perforated 
    by the disease in respect to which the party are in consultation” (Stephens, 
    BM Sat.). The <a href="lord.htm">nobleman</a> is holding out to Misaubin a 
    pill box, playfully threatening with his cane. The <a href="girl.htm">girl</a> 
    of indeterminate age at his side (anywhere from six to sixty) wears the same 
    cap the <a href="../marriage2/dog.htm">dog was sniffing in the nobleman's 
    pocket </a><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(Pl.2).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This 
    girl, his mistress, &quot;is applying a white handkerchief to her lips, as 
    if to a sore,&quot; as Stephens notices. The <a href="woman.htm">other woman</a> 
    has been explained in various ways.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Rouquet (p. 34), who may have obtained his interpretation 
    from Hogarth himself, explains that Hogarth has introduced the nobleman into: 
  </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:48.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>1'appartement d'un empirique, ou <span class=GramE>il</span>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Trusler, 
    who may have derived his information from Mrs. Hogarth (p. 75), dubiously

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Anecdotes of Painting in England,</i> where
he speaks about our artist, affirms that the main idea in his work was always
comprehensible. True as this is for by far the greater part of his engravings,
it does not quite apply to the present one. There are, if I am not mistaken, no
less than five different interpretations of this scene. This circumstance alone
would be sufficient evidence of its obscurity, but an anecdote which Mr Ireland
quotes to the same end is too remarkable to be omitted here. On some occasion
when the well-known poet Churchill was asked about the meaning of this
engraving, he confessed that it had always seemed to him so ambiguous that one
day he had asked the artist himself for an explanation, but he, like many another
<span class=GramE>commentator</span>, had left it as obscure as it had been
before. 'And I am therefore,' proceeded the poet, 'quite convinced that he
based his tale upon an idea of Hoadley, Garrick, Townley, or some other friend,
and never rightly understood himself what it meant.' In this remark one can
sense the cynic's bitterness. Mr Ireland further comments, in connection with
the <span class=GramE>story, that</span> this opinion of Churchill's was given
at a time when the unfortunate quarrel between him and Hogarth had already
broken out. It may happen, though, to the most honest man that in a fit of
philosophical penetration or poetical inspiration, especially just before Mass,
he will write something which he himself no longer understands when Mass is
over. These are the lightning flashes of genius, and lightning does not take
aim; nor do flashes of genius, any more than natural storms—especially thunder
without lightning—leave any trace, either in the element from which they come,
or in that into which they go. But a work of art like this one is not just
flashed on to the canvas by a single <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coup
de main.</i> Each separate line of the attack must be planned and visualized
before it is executed, and afterwards it must undergo still more aiming and
planning, for days, even weeks, and it would be a queer thing indeed if the
besieger were not to see what he wanted to take by storm. Hogarth certainly saw
it, and saw it clearly. We shall now see whether we cannot indicate, by a few
slowly convergent straight lines, the proper direction of his manifold ordnance,
and thus the position of the main targets. We shall not prolong these lines as
far as their meeting points; our paper is too small for that. We therefore beg
the indulgent reader to transfer them from here on to a somewhat larger canvas
and then apply his own ruler to them, and everything else will come by itself.
And, after thus reducing the solution of the problem to a mere linear plan, we
can, I think, afford to be brief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It has already been hinted several times, and fairly
distinctly, that the young <a href="lord.htm">Viscount</a> was neither quite
healthy nor otherwise quite <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>comme-il-faut.</i>
But all this was mere rumour. There was mention of a plaster behind the left
ear and of some muslin and ribbon in his pocket and so on. But here we obtain
reliable official confirmation that all is really so and, so to speak, straight
from the Viscount's own mouth. We see him here in the consulting room of a
certain Monsieur de la Pillule, a <a href="quack.htm">French doctor</a> who
specializes in that type of disease which the linguistic usage of all nations
has made a co-national of Monsieur le Docteur, and which is probably treated by
him, on account of that relationship, with profitable care and leniency. His
name we learn from a copy of the impressive tome which lies open there on his
right, and the success of his practice can be inferred from the whole
appearance of the elegant room with its vaulted window overlooking the street,
and from what is loudly proclaimed not by architecture alone but by all the realms
of art and nature on the walls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Presumably this is also the establishment where our hero
was stamped behind the ear. Together with the <a href="girl.htm">poor immature
creature</a> who stands on his left, he has just arrived at Monsieur de la Pillule's,
to whom he has also invited, or brought along, the more than mature witch on
his right. Now the quarrel develops, the cause of which is as follows: his
Lordship has hired the little creature from the old woman's educational
institute, to serve as companion in his extra-domestic household, for an
indefinite time and at a high price. For this, the <a href="woman.htm">Mother
Superior</a> of that Nunnery guarantees in her novices immature youthfulness,
innocence, complete ignorance of gallicism of any kind, and therefore complete
security. The last item was very necessary on account of his domestic
household, and the immaturity was really made an explicit condition, mainly
because of fashion, but partly also because of the increased security. And in
this, alas! <span class=GramE>his</span> Lordship found himself miserably and
quite irreparably damaged. He is surely within his rights, for the old hag,
instead of remonstrance, immediately draws her pocket knife against the defamer
of her institute. But he, for his part, is about to produce an argument against
which the mere tongue-wagging of the procuress will be powerless. The young and
candid creature has, in fact, confessed to him herself that she has used the
doctor's pills before, and is still using them. They have therefore brought the
whole supply with them to lay here before the tribunal. His Lordship holds a
little box open in his hand, and shows it to the quack, who is perhaps one of
the girl's underwriters, probably with some such words as these: 'Look here.
Monsieur, are not these the self-same pills which I've already taken myself
more than a hundred times?' He may be presenting them also to the Mother
Superior: 'Aren't these the cough lozenges which you provide for your nuns?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>I believe this is the simplest solution of the puzzle,
because it also explains the expression on the face of the poor victim, in
which predominates an eloquent fear of the old dragon, and of the castigation
awaiting her in the nunnery for telling tales. The supply of pills was not
negligible, since the child has another little box in her hand, if it is not
the lid of the open one, and yet another lies on the chair in front of his
Lordship, from which it would certainly fall were it not that the angle formed
by his Lordship's thighs had made a suitable resting place for it. That his
Lordship has sat down for the poor creature's sake, as if to put himself on a
level with her, and even takes her between his legs, is a very subtle and
striking touch of our artist's. It shows how small, childish, and in need of
help the little creature appears, even in the eyes of a good-for-nothing. Had
he been a sincere defender or avenger of innocence, surely that position in
itself would have secured him the spectator's affection. As it is, it only
increases our horror of the disgusting, brutish voluptuary. It seems unlikely
that he raises his Spanish cane to administer a real thrashing--he only
brandishes it a little so as to give the ironic amiability of his face and the
light mockery of his words the proper cudgel-like solidity, by which alone it
is possible to make oneself understood in such society. The Mother Superior's
defence with the knife cannot be of any special consequence. Nothing more comes
of it. Probably Monsieur de la Pillule interposed with the volubility that
belongs to his nation as well as his profession. This would be quite in his
line; a main ingredient of pills like his was always the gilt of oratory: it
would thus not be difficult for him who had concluded so many more difficult
peace treaties between ego and non- ego, in which this gilt was a main
ingredient, to conclude one so easy as that between cane and pocket-knife,
through the gilt alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Be that as it may, the pious dame now grasps her
pocket-knife, just as her adversary the half-raised stick, as a stress accent
for those who might still find anything equivocal in the expression of their
faces. On her bosom can be seen the letters F.C., probably etched with
gunpowder. If the English police had found it advisable to subdivide into companies
the Light Regiment in which that piece of hussar had served forty years ago,
then the letters might denote First Company; also Free Corps, or Filia
Carissima—in the nunnery, that is; or if the kerchief covered'the name of the
founder, owner, or landlord, then they might also stand for the well-known
Fieri Curavit or Faciendum curavit N.N. According to Dr Nichols, the letters
stand for Fanny Cock, the daughter of an auctioneer named Cock with whom
Hogarth had a quarrel. Whether he also had some quarrel with the daughter is
not known; probably she herself had one with the public. But whatever the
letters may mean, they are characteristic enough in this context, for among all
London's pious dames, Mothers Superior and Prioresses, those with burnt or etched
mottoes are the most infamous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span class=GramE>Now
for a glance at Monsieur de la Pillule himself.</span> It is to be hoped that
the reader will be fully indemnified thereby for the nausea which the rest of
the company may have caused him. It is impossible to look at this man, who
either gilds everything he touches or turns it into money, without feeling a
few years younger. Only look at his gold mouth! What a source of comfort,
especially when he spouts broken English! And beneath it a nose which surely
represents the most perfect saddle ever ridden by spectacles. Do our readers
recollect perhaps a description which Fabre d'Eglantine has given of the
blessed Marat? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Oh, c'est Marat <span
class=GramE>tout</span> craché!</i> Even if a touch were missing here and
there, no one could easily miss 'the eye, naturally gentle, even charming, and
yet penetrating, the short thighs and the bow legs' of Marat. If the wig was
only perched a little more to one side, I should believe it was Marat himself
drawn immediately after the box on the ear which led to his theory of light. He
wipes his spectacles for the inspection of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>corpus delicti,</i> which he can hardly avoid doing. Upon his table
lies a book which has the appearance of being clasped by a somewhat curious
skull that had evidently in life been gnawed by the compatriot disease. It is
permissible to draw conclusions from such a padlock about the contents of the
jewel box; there must be something of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>momento
mori</i> in it. In that case, it could either contain the mysteries of the
doctor's poison-brewing art, or it might be the book of life in which he enters
the names and the debts of the blessed cured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Opposite that closed book, at the other side of the
consulting room, lies an open one. An arrangement like that is almost
reminiscent of the German promotion ceremony for the Doctor's Degree at which,
as is well- known, the candidate is recommended in a fatherly but serious
manner to apply himself not only to the opening of books but to their shutting
as well, at the proper time. In France, however, to the best of my knowledge,
that custom is not in fashion; at least, there is nothing about it printed in
the protocol of Doctor Molière. Moreover, the open book of our Doctor is his
own work, and in any learned establishment such books surely open by
themselves. The full title of the work, which consists of two moderately sized
volumes, is as follows: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Explication de

tire-bouchon, <span class=GramE>inventées</span> par Monsr de la Pillule. Vues <span
class=GramE>et</span> approuvées par I'Académie Royale des Sciences à Paris.</i>
Thus it is a description of two machines, one of which serves to set dislocated
shoulders, the other to pull corks out of bottles, both examined by the Royal
Academy of Sciences at Paris, and approved forthwith. That means something.
Such an honour is only shown by the Academy of Sciences to people whose value
is already established. If he is a poor un- known devil, they will either
examine his work stringently, or, if there is no time for this, they will only
glance at it and reject it. From the appearance of both machines which Hogarth
shows us here, the verdict of the Academy appears completely <span class=GramE>justified.</span>
One need only look at them to approve of that. In the first volume, as we just
read in an old review, the author shows the use of the machine for dislocated
shoulders: he explains how the patient is to be properly strapped on, made
rigid, and screwed down. By one of the springs which we see here, the end of a
napkin gathered into a ball is <a href="head.htm">pressed into his <span
class=GramE>mouth</span></a><span class=GramE>,</span> and as the tension and
therefore the pain increases, more and more of the napkin is intruded, so that
the patient is completely prevented from crying out. Upon the great jagged pole
at the back is fixed a very finely adjusted measuring scale which he calls <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>points de démembrement.</i> If now the
machine is set at the proper point, depending upon the age and strength of the
patient, one may boldly wind like an organ-grinder without fear that the
patient will be torn apart, since before this could happen the great hook (a
sort of lock) will fall into the third wheel, and stop the machine, and the
patient remains whole. One more revolution and the patient is torn apart (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>démembrement</i>); hence the name of the
measuring scale. In the second volume, the author shows how the machine could
easily be used for uprooting old stumps of oak trees, and even raises the hope
that it might serve for restoring leaning steeples to their proper elevation.
Very modestly, almost like Archimedes, he requires for this only a little spot
of earth on which to stand. But vigorously and strongly though it performs one
of its functions, so gently and tenderly, one might almost say kindly, does it
perform another. For he claims to have extracted with it the teeth of
personages of high rank, even the corks of the bottles on their dinner tables.
The part which serves for drawing corks he has worked on specially, so that it
can be separated from the rest and used by <span class=GramE>itself,</span> and
this is the marvellous idea which we see materialized there on the floor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Although it is evident that Hogarth has displayed all this
here <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in majoram gloriam</i> of the noble
simplicity of the medical art in general, and of French surgery in particular,
which, as he intimates, is capable of dispelling diseases of all kinds without
much ado, whether rooted like oak trees or sitting lightly like corks, the
downy bird still cannot suppress his mockery of the venerable de la Pillule. He
has carried this so far that with the best will in the world to think the
opposite, we are inclined to believe that Hogarth's sole intention with all
that machinery was to indicate that Monsieur de la Pillule was a charlatan and
a shark who made preparations for cutting nails as if for amputating a thigh,
and afterwards, in the Book of Life, entered his charges accordingly. One need
only look at the cup- board with the glass doors over there; that sort of thing
could not possibly be meant as a recommendation. On top of it we see a rather
curious tripod. It is hardly the tripod of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pythia,</i>
although the whole shelf looks like an antique shop. It seems rather to be a
tripod of another sort, from which, instead of the unknown being foretold as at
Delphi, something well known is proclaimed. Yes, it is quite certainly the sort
of tripod whose sight has comforted many a poor traveller in Germany whom some
landlord has despoiled of half his purse; he sees that on the highway, at
least, he need not worry about the other half. It is the well-known legal
tripod—the gallows. It hovers here like a halo or a coronet above three figures
which represent man, and more especially the laboratory of his thought, like
the three layers of an onion—<a href="skull.htm">the skeleton, the skin, and
the wig</a>. Unfortunately, the noblest layer, the wig, is none other than our
doctor's. That it sits here upon a somewhat more beautiful carving makes no
difference. From the outside he might really have looked like that in earlier
years, and from the inside they still probably resemble each other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The group would bear more than one
explanation to be sure, but none would be able to explain our doctor away from
beneath the gallows. The naked figure, it is believed, might be a patient, and
the other two, doctors in consultation, one of whom is our doctor here, and the
other the famous <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>medicinae practicus</i>
of whose humane behaviour Horace sings as truly as beautifully, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:24.0pt;
mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas Regumque
turres.</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>The
latter, though, does as if he were angry with the former, but only because the
patient is listening; fundamentally, both are making common cause. Or, one
might be already in bliss, and has come to succour the other who is not yet
quite so far gone: 'Are you going to &quot;cure&quot; him to a skeleton as you
did me, you scoundrel?' Or both might have been hanged, one dried honestly in
chains, the other dishonestly dissected, for which he is making the bitterest
reproaches to the Faculty. 'It's still a question,' he says, 'which of us two
is the more [de]pendable, you or I.' <span class=GramE>Or</span> they may
represent a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Concilium medicum</i> in general.
In a word, one sees that the three-leaved clover in the cupboard is a
gallows-pendant, and our doctor the 'pendant' (in the metaphorical sense of the
word) to the skeleton. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The laboratory at the back seems to be a mere show-piece—a
chemical kitchen in which no cooking is ever done. The glass apparatus in it
apparently serves the same purpose for the doctor's pills as the oak tree
extractor does for his corks. He himself does not draw his corks in this way,
nor does he make his pills in that. Everything here has been chosen, not for
its necessity and usefulness, but to impress with its splendour and pomp,
together with a dash of terror. Quacks are good at that. They know that without
window-dressing the masses cannot be served with physical or spiritual food, <span
class=GramE>nor</span> with the foods of the chemist's shop either, which are
something between the two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>On the wall above
the cupboard hangs a whole encyclopaedia of showpieces of every kind, evidently
intended to inspire his patients with feelings of awe or perhaps to afford them
some preliminary entertainment until the doctor had made up his mind on the
appropriate final jibber-jabber. It is a well-established fact that many people
can talk, if not very well, at least tolerably, on matters of which they
understand nothing, provided they are allowed, for the fortification of their
inner confidence as well as the increased energy of their jaws, a little time
to dwell on things which are familiar to them, and of which the listener
understands nothing. As such a running start to the main objective, the
collection up there is not at all badly designed. For there will hardly be a
soul except the owner who would understand all the little object lessons hanging
up there. Beauty is hardly represented, but rather the great and the sublime.
The collection begins on the left with a huge narwhal's tooth which, if seen as
a horn growing out of the procuress's head, adds not a little to the fury in
her face. But this is not the meaning of it, at least not the only one. That is
still to come. Then there follow a few bricks, probably baked more than 2,000
years ago, a barber's basin, shaped like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mambrin’s</i>
helmet, a urine bottle evidently for the reception of some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>aqua regia</i> of prehistory; giant bones, giant children's heads with
small pipes or tubes to emit smoke and fire, gigantic combs against gigantic
pests, and between these colossal magnifications of the small stands the
colossal diminution of one of the most uplifting objects in the civilized
world. Next to it hangs—once antiquated but now again the dernier cri—the
high-crowned hat; more properly the felt knock-and-shock absorber. That is why
it is left partly empty. That emptiness extends, when even the best heads are
stuck into it, to at least half the height, with others to two-thirds and over,
and, occasionally, according to the kind of heads, to the whole. Then follow
the insignia of nobility, the spur, the shield and the lance of youth and the
slippers of old age; two crocodiles, one with amputated legs and an ostrich
egg, since no better was available, and the other with a chain on its lower
jaw; finally, a monster and an insect almost too big and too many- legged for
the giant comb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Whether Hogarth had a purpose in displaying just these
relics is difficult to decide; but it is quite possible, even if we regard the
whole cabinet as a perfect general satire upon certain collectors of all the
rubbish of Nature and Art. For nobody understood better than he the art of
adding, with inimitable roguery, to what is of general appeal in his art some
other ingredients which would only act with full force upon such individuals as
would be <span class=GramE>specially</span> sensitive to it, by reason of some
hidden defect. A touch of this sort is to be found here, one which hits at the
learned descent of our Monsieur de la Pillule. He has had the unfortunate idea
of putting up his narwhal's tooth at a slant, thus transforming it into the
generally recognized shop-sign of the barber (the barber's pole), and then, an
untoward fate caused him to place <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mambrin’s</i>
helmet, the barber's basin, and the urine bottle so close to the pole that
through that hieroglyph the well-stocked room of Monsieur de la Pillule becomes
a barber's shop and he himself a urine-wise barber, who could only jabber about
medicine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Thus the doctor's collection may perhaps be interpreted
partly historically, partly prophetically, indicating his life-history as
follows: he began as a barber, then became a urine diviner, surreptitiously gained
the doctor's hat soon afterwards through his cures, though just missing the
gallows by a hair's breadth, and now even reckons upon a knighthood, if he has
not won it already. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The two pictures hanging on the left wall of the room
represent two monsters, one of which has both arms growing out of its head. It
is perhaps, as Mr Ireland believes, one of Sir John Mandeville's cannibals: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:24.0pt;
mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Whose heads</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:24.0pt;
mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Do grow beneath their
shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Its
arms hang down in the painting like the ornamental wings of the noblest type of
wig. The other monster has, without a trace of further reduplication, simply
two heads. If these creatures really existed, which I do not doubt, we can only
regard them as some well-meant attempts on the part of Nature to give the
writer's profession a better foundation at last. The two ways in which this
purpose could be quickly achieved are obvious: either each writer should be
given two heads, one for the daily domesticities, for smoking, taking snuff,
compilation and mystification, and another for solemn thought, for the
uninterrupted acquisition of knowledge and for writing proper; or if, as
hitherto, everything has to be accomplished by a single head, then such an
important instrument for the writing of books as the arm with its hand should not
be suspended from the shoulder, but rather from the head itself. Why this
beautiful project has not materialized I do not know. Perhaps the booksellers
were against it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On the right, over the door leading to the kitchen, hangs
another picture; also a monster. It is not clearly visible; however, from the
brazenness with which it presents itself, that is, from the extended legs and
out- stretched arms, we may conclude that it must have something curious to
show. Having taken a great deal of trouble with this creature, I believe I have
found that it represents a new variety of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Janus
bifrons,</i> that is, one in whom the positive and negative front, I mean the
face and the seat, lie on one and the same side, and who thus, wherever he
turns, be it to the past or the future, not only looks at people, but shows
them something too. For it is clear that with this creature, the navel does not
appear on the same side as the face, from which it naturally follows that
whatever as a rule is not on the side of the face must here appear on it. That
the Janus of ancient Rome, before he shut himself in at the conclusion of
peace, never showed himself to the people like that, is pretty certain. But
what he did or ought to have done in modern Rome before he recently shut the
temple door there cannot be determined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>If somebody wanted to draw the life-line of Monsieur de la
Pillule through this fifth point also, I would suggest his considering whether
the picture cannot be interpreted as the dog-like fawning and flattery of that
class of human beings; for my readers are aware that some little dogs do not
know how to make their masters a greater compliment than to approach them
wriggling like snakes and showing them, just like that picture at the
conclusion of peace, both fronts simultaneously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Above the quite sizeable medicine chest on the left, a
terrible hyena head, or whatever it is, threatens with destruction anyone who
comes near it. Certainly a very telling symbol for the poison chest above which
it hangs; a proper <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>noli me tangere,</i>
keep away from me! Or it portends cannibalism. From this viewpoint, the head
would fit in very well with Sir John Mandeville's cannibals. Of course,
Monsieur le Docteur will interpret it quite differently by pointing to the
diseases which have found their inevitable end in his jars and boxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to the poison chest Hogarth has excellently, it seems
to me, placed two mummies. Out of their infinite security and after their
thousand <span class=GramE>years</span> truce with the healing faculty, they
look down, evidently with proud contemptuous looks, on all the quack turmoil
and the drug trash of this world; which one can do if one is—a mummy. The
doctor's overcoat and hat, thrown upon the floor, are evidence of his activity,
his haste to save life, and his great practice. (102-113).</p>
