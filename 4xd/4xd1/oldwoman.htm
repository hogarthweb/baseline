    for his portrait of Bridget Allworthy (Tom Jones, Bk. I, Chap. 11) and by 
    Cowper for his portrait of a prude in &quot;Truth&quot; (11. 131-70). She

    had been made considerably in his favour) is admirably delineated.<span

    which generally accompanies her order, and is an exact type of a hard winter; 
    for every part of her dress, except the flying lappets and apron, ruffled

    </font></b>The main figure in the whole picture for which all the other splendours 
    of the winter sky and the winter earth with its snow and riches serve only 
    as a frame, so to speak, is the lovely pedestrian in the centre. You can see 
    she is already beyond the first stage of a religious devotee whose double 
    duty, toward heaven and her neighbour, she has this morning partly fulfilled, 
    and partly is about to fulfil. She is on her way to church and at a time of 
    day and year when even the decision to do so proclaims a sanctity which was 
    never imparted to a wholly sinful heart; and how much does she not care for 
    her neighbour! For to be sure, she would not doll herself up like that for 
    her own benefit. She must have started already at four o clock that morning, 
    thus by artificial light; we cannot be surprised, therefore, if in practice 
    everything has not turned out exactly as theory intended it should. It is 
    a well-known principle in the building of kitchens that they should be light 
    enough not to need any artificial light during daytime. But anything which 
    is prepared by artificial light can as a rule, be served to advantage only 
    under such light; and by this token I should imagine that the lady might be 
    acceptable by candlelight We must also take the season into account here; 
    the brightness of the snow as well as the cold are not at all favourable for 
    certain little flowers- only peach blossoms thrive in the snow. But now to 
    the subject in a more serious vein and in a manner more worthy of it. We have 
    here, in the year 1738 a lady who would still like to look what it was already 
    too late for at the end of the last century--charming.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Beauty spots (mouches) float about her gleaming eye like midges round 
    a candle flame, a warning to any young man whose glances would like to imitate 
    them. On her cheek of course, one notices something like a birth certificate 
    in indelible writing But it is not really that; there are wrinkles, it is 
    true, but they spring surely from the comers of the mouth where Cupid plays 
    his little pranks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This gentle play
communicates itself to the cheeks in tiny waves which propagating more and
more, like ripples, withdraw finally behind the ears.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the bosom still shows its gentle
undulation, although there the ice is already forming. The right arm wears its
winter garment quite negligently and easily, while the hand with the fan (in winter!)
succours the lip which with that strained smile is no longer able by itself to
cover the gap in the teeth. However, only two fingers are needed to look after
both, fan and lip. How daintily this charming damsel handles everything! I can
wager that lip grips its syllables just like the hand does its fan. The way she
holds her neck is a master stroke, especially when combined with the gentle
inclination of the upper part other body. It seems as if the neck, through
gentle elastic opposition, would promote the glorious waving of the pennant which
flows out there from the gable into the morning air. What a pity it is that
pennants have gone out of fashion! The times are not what they were, to be
sure; nowadays, when Divine Service has ended, the procession looks just about
as brilliant as a queue for alms; in the old days it used to look like a fleet
setting sail with all the world's splendour on board. Wherever it sailed,
victory attended. Everybody saluted and everybody struck&#8212;the hat; it was
irresistible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The lady is not only unmarried&#8212;but has never been
married. All the interpreters agree in this, and I must confess I have no
objection to raise. Whoever has long been a spinster, with all the little
fineries which that state unfortunately entails, gets to like them in the end;
indeed, the little bits of affectation increase since they become more and more
necessary and cease only with the end of the spinsterhood, or with the spinster
herself. This is as human as it can be. I should not like to decide whether
even the wisest of men, were he to live for five hundred years like Cagliostro,
in order to 'sell' his higher wisdom, would not also make an advertising face
in the end, which would appear to our more naive philosophers, or to the angels
in Heaven, like the face of that spinster. Merely through force of habit man
cannot become better on his way through life, and to get over this he must
first die. I also seem to remember that somebody has called the day of death a
wedding day. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Les beaux esprits se
rencontrent</i>&#8212;just like philosophy and spinsterhood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What may have been responsible for the definite opinion of
the interpreters is perhaps the excessive dryness of the subject. Nichols even
calls her 'the exhausted representative of involuntary spinsterhood'. Of
course, all prolonged tending of fire is bad for the health, and none more so
than that of the Vestals' fire. Just as ordinary metal smelters are subject to
lead poisoning, an occupational disease of foundry work, so are the heart
smelters to what one might call the Vestals' occupational disease. But&#8212;
by God! the former still leave us the metal, whereas with the latter both
smelter and metal are lost. Have mercy on them! would I exclaim over their
bosoms had I not just noticed in that saint's eye a glance at the scene in
front of Tom King's Coffee House, which stifles my pity. All is not yet lost.
Sounding boards are no impediment to happiness in married life. The dull murmur
of reproach achieves distinctness thereby, the private sermonizing obtains more
life, and the orders to the servants the needful volume upstairs and down,
without all of which no household can exist. The wooden figure as it stands
there has cost our good artist rather dear; it is in fact the portrait of an
old spinster with whom he was, if not exactly related, at least very well
acquainted. She is said to have been quite content at first with her role in
the work of her friend, probably on account of its close similarity to the
beloved original. A sentiment of such rare good nature, though based only upon
ignorance of worldly intrigues, would have well merited Hogarth's blotting out
the figure of the heroine who had expressed it. But that certain type of good
friend who is never missing persuaded him to leave the magnificent figure, not
without endeavouring, at the same time, to enlighten the lady as to the scandal
of such a procedure, and with such good effect that in the end her portrait
remained, but on account of it Hogarth was blotted out from the matron's Last
Will, in which he would gladly have remained, she having rather handsomely
provided for him there. Whoever hopes to inherit something from an old aunt
should beware of making any satires upon women over fifty, but should be the
ruder to all under forty. Readers of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tom
Jones</i> will remember here that Fielding, when he describes the appearance of
Tom's and Blifield's mother, expressly states that she looked like this lady,
and Fielding, as one knows, read her character very well. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

(276-278).</p>
