    and subtlety of the painter’s <span

    background is a pattern of wintry tones—a huddle of drab-hued passers-by: 
    a leaden firmament weighing heavily upon the spectral pallor of snow-bound 
    roofs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the foreground is alive 
    with <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> and movement; although the air is sharp and the light 
    is dim, the young men from a night’s dissipation are full of zest and rowdy 
    <span class=SpellE>vigour</span>, boldly <span class=SpellE>towsling</span> 
    and bussing the girls, one of whom has a hat with a bright blue lining; while 
    the scarlet ribbons of the church-<span class=SpellE>goer’s</span> cap match 
    the spurting scarlet flames of the market-woman’s bonfire.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her expression, incidentally, is far less disdainful 
    in the canvas than in the engraved plate; and she, too, has come out in her 
    gayest plumage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She carries a fashionable 
    ermine muff, and wears a pale pink apron over a champagne-yellow dress, which 
    has trimmings of a delicate sea-green (149-150). </span></p>

who had a very good sense of what many a writer and artist prefers to ignore, that
is, the part for which Nature had intended him, has chosen to represent this
time of the day, not by any of the great soul- uplifting scenes of a spring or
summer morning, but a winter one, and there again, not the funereal pomp of the
frost-encrusted bushes where winter sleeps until its resurrection, or the pine
forest moaning under its flaky burden of snow, but—Covent Garden vegetable
market in London. That is where he feels at home. What, in fact, could his
particular genius have made of a May morning in the country? No doubt a few
wretched nightingale catchers with their all-too-familiar courtier faces,
enticing those sweet songstresses into a trap without even noticing that the
sun is rising over their noble occupation; or a few belles of doubtful reputation
engaged in emptying bottles of May dew over one another's heads, with gestures
and grimaces which no May dew will ever wash off. What he would make of a
winter landscape, the reader will be able to surmise from what he is going to
see and read here about a winter morning at the vegetable market. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It is just eight, as can be seen from the church clock,
very cold, and snow has fallen. The impressions which we observe in the
foreground come from the iron mounting of small wooden shoes (<span
class=SpellE>pattens</span>) which were then worn by the female population, and
enabled them to glide, to the advantage of shoes and feet, a few inches above
the mud of the streets. These were the sort of footprints they made in the year
1738; now everything is more civilized. The clatter made by these little
horse-shoes on the London pavements is by no means disagreeable to a stranger's
ear especially if-as is mostly the case-the pedestrians are pretty Did one not
see that they were pedestrians, one might sometimes take them for cavalry approaching,
at least light cavalry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The main figure in the whole picture for which all the
other <span class=SpellE>splendours</span> of the winter sky and the winter
earth with its snow and riches serve only as a frame, so to speak, is the <a
href="oldwoman.htm">lovely pedestrian</a> in the centre. You can see she is
already beyond the first stage of a religious devotee whose double duty, toward
heaven and her <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>, she has this morning partly
fulfilled, and partly is about to <span class=SpellE>fulfil</span>. She is on
her way to church and at a time of day and year when even the decision to do so
proclaims a sanctity which was never imparted to a wholly sinful heart; and how
much <span class=GramE>does she not care</span> for her <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>!
For to be sure, she would not doll herself up like that for her own benefit.
She must have started already at four o clock that morning, thus by artificial
light; we cannot be surprised, therefore, <span class=GramE>if</span> in
practice everything has not turned out exactly as theory intended it should. It
is a well-known principle in the building of kitchens that they should be light
enough not to need any artificial light during daytime. But anything which is
prepared by artificial light can as a rule, be served to advantage only under
such light; and by this token I should imagine that the lady might be acceptable
by candlelight We must also take the season into account here; the brightness
of the snow as well as the cold are not at all <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
for certain little flowers- only peach blossoms thrive in the snow. <span
class=GramE>But now to the subject in a more serious vein and in a manner more
worthy of it.</span> We have here, in the year 1738 a lady who would still like
to look what it was already too late for at the end of the last
century--charming.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Beauty
spots (<span class=SpellE>mouches</span>) float about her gleaming eye like
midges round a candle flame, a warning to any young man whose glances would
like to imitate them.</span> On her cheek of course, one notices something like
a birth certificate in indelible writing <span class=GramE>But</span> it is not
really that; there are wrinkles, it is true, but they spring surely from the
comers of the mouth where Cupid plays his little pranks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This gentle play
communicates itself to the cheeks in tiny waves which propagating more and
more, like ripples, withdraw finally behind the ears.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the bosom still shows its gentle
undulation, although there the ice is already forming. The right arm wears its
winter garment quite negligently and easily, while the hand with the fan (in
winter!) <span class=SpellE>succours</span> the lip which with that strained
smile is no longer able by itself to cover the gap in the teeth. However, only
two fingers are needed to look after both, fan and lip. How daintily this
charming damsel handles everything! I can wager that lip grips its syllables
just like the hand does its fan. The way she holds her neck is a master stroke,
especially when combined with the gentle inclination of the upper part other
body. It seems as if the neck, through gentle elastic opposition, would promote
the glorious waving of the pennant which flows out there from the gable into
the morning air. What a pity it is that pennants have gone out of fashion! The
times are not what they were, to be sure; nowadays, when Divine Service has
ended, the procession looks just about as brilliant as a queue for alms; in the
old days it used to look like a fleet setting sail with <span class=GramE>all
the</span> world's <span class=SpellE>splendour</span> on board. Wherever it
sailed, victory attended. Everybody saluted and everybody struck—the hat; it
was irresistible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The lady is not only unmarried—but has never been married.
All the interpreters agree in this, and I must confess I have no objection to <span
class=GramE>raise</span>. Whoever has long been a spinster, with all the little
fineries which that state unfortunately entails, gets to like them in the end;
indeed, the little bits of affectation increase since they become more and more
necessary and cease only with the end of the spinsterhood, or with the spinster
<span class=GramE>herself.</span> This is as human as it can be. I should not
like to decide whether even the wisest of men, were he to live for five hundred
years like <span class=SpellE>Cagliostro</span>, in order to 'sell' his higher
wisdom, would not also make an advertising face in the end, which would appear
to our more naive philosophers, or to the angels in Heaven, like the face of
that spinster. Merely through force of habit man cannot become better on his
way through life, and to get over this he must first die. I also seem to
remember that somebody has called the day of death a wedding day. <span

spinsterhood.</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What may have been responsible for the definite opinion of
the interpreters is perhaps the excessive dryness of the subject. Nichols even
calls her 'the exhausted representative of involuntary spinsterhood'. Of
course, all prolonged tending of fire is bad for the health, and none more so
than that of the Vestals' fire. Just as ordinary metal smelters are subject to
lead poisoning, an occupational disease of foundry work, so are the heart
smelters to what one might call the Vestals' occupational disease. But— by God!
<span class=GramE>the</span> former still leave us the metal, whereas with the
latter both smelter and metal are lost. Have mercy on them! <span class=GramE>would</span>
I exclaim over their bosoms had I not just noticed in that saint's eye a glance
at the scene in front of Tom King's Coffee House, which stifles my pity. All is
not yet lost. Sounding boards are no impediment to happiness in married life.
The dull murmur of reproach achieves distinctness thereby, the private
sermonizing obtains more <span class=GramE>life,</span> and the orders to the
servants the needful volume upstairs and down, without all of which no
household can exist. The wooden figure as it stands there has cost our good
artist rather dear; it is in fact the portrait of an old spinster with whom he
was, if not exactly related, at least very well acquainted. She is said to have
been quite content at first with her role in the work of her friend, probably
on account of its close similarity to the beloved original. A sentiment of such
rare good nature, though based only upon ignorance of worldly intrigues, would
have well merited <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> blotting out the figure
of the heroine who had expressed it. But that certain type of good friend who

class=SpellE>endeavouring</span>, at the same time, to enlighten the lady as to
the scandal of such a procedure, and with such good effect that in the end her
portrait remained, but on account of it <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> was
blotted out from the matron's Last Will, in which he would gladly have
remained, she having rather handsomely provided for him there. Whoever hopes to
inherit something from an old aunt should beware of making any satires upon
women over fifty, but should be the ruder to all under forty. Readers of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tom Jones</i> will remember here that
Fielding, when he describes the appearance of Tom's and <span class=SpellE>Blifield's</span>
mother, expressly states that she looked like this lady, and Fielding, as one
knows, read her character very well. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tom

he has no stockings on. For this I was criticized by an Englishman of mature
judgment; such a thing, he said, would be unheard of in England. The mistake is
easily corrected: I have only to say that he presumably wears stockings. A more
miserable, starving, and frozen object would be hard to imagine; in such
circumstances, of course that inner peace cannot fail him which here plays
about his eyes and lips. Under his arm he carries a voluminous prayer-book,
apparently the only comfort which his mistress has vouchsafed him against all
this misfortune <span class=GramE>That</span> is how the old, rich aunts
behave, especially about the time when they are laying their Last Will; they
hatch them better that way too. </p>

say it is probable that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> helped to arouse
justice; for these engravings appeared towards the end of the year 1738, and in
June 1739 Madame King was arrested. Her sentence was: she was to raze the
“sacristy” to the ground, pay a fine of £200, go to <span class=SpellE>Newgate</span>
for three months, and if then the fine was still unpaid, she was to stay there
until she had forked out the last penny; apart from all this, she was to give
security with a considerable sum to be on conduct for the next three
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an excellent expedient of
English justice for clipping the wings of people who have strayed into such an
occupation. For should they stray again, the security will be lost, and justice
will then, as a rule, cut a little deeper still, or will even hang the little
bird without further clipping, according to circumstances. However, Madame King
paid up and conducted <span class=GramE>herself</span> well, and with the
remaining offertory pennies from St Paul's Church built three cottages not far
from Hampstead, a village near London set upon a charming hill; to this day
these are still called Moll King's Row. There, in September 1747, she died,
apparently in her bed. From the fine imposed on her, as well as from the
offertory pennies, the reader will be able to judge for himself what may have
been going on in close vicinity to the columns of that house of the Lord. </p>

text-autospace:none'><a href="fighting.htm">The nest has opened just now</a>;
the proceedings must have been pretty warm in there last night, for they have
melted even the snow upon the roof. First to be flung out is a wig of some standing,
though a false friend to its <span class=GramE>master</span> whom it has
deserted in time of trouble, leaving his bald head under a hail of blows
instead of helping to ward them off. There is something very funny about the
flight of that wig. Had it been a learned company which is being conducted to
the door there, one might, at least in the half-light, almost take it for
Minerva's bird that had presided over the night's proceedings, or for a lyre
which like Spenser's harp rises to Heaven to greet the morning star. The van of
the company which is spewed out here hurl themselves like liberated beasts upon
a couple of <a href="lovers.htm">innocent creatures</a>, one of whom has come
here to sell garden plants and the other, with the basket upon her arm, to
shop, and who have arrived thus early. The fellow with the braided hat is said
to be Irish: his wig has remained faithful to him, but it has suffered not a
little in service. In any other place than upon a head it would hardly be
regarded as a wig at all. Next to the fire sits a <a href="beggar.htm">creature</a>
who would surely be much flattered if we said that she looks almost human. She
seems to be dumb, or else her vocal chords have perhaps suffered in a fight,
for like a medicine bottle she wears a label round her neck upon which is
written what is to be found there. It is her history, though it is not this
which she presents to the old spinster, but the abominable facts themselves—her
face. She is a beggar; can she entertain any hopes, seeing the beggar in
livery? But he addresses himself only to his mistress's love of mankind and
freezes for it. And here in public something may be expected from vanity
enhanced by publicity. </p>

doctor Rock</a> with his notice-board and his little potions and lotions,
advertising himself and his medicines, to those who have fallen for the
temptations of the illness in which he deals. In spite of its being so early
and cold, he already has an audience, among them a woman wearing a hood because
of the cold and the onlookers. Doctor Rock is said to be a true likeness, in
spite of being a portrait delineated with so few strokes. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
is extraordinarily gracious towards this man; he uses every opportunity of
recommending him to posterity. What can he have done for him? </p>

unwillingly to school'. At the moment this is done by staying put. Their

mast with the pennant. Poor auntie! <span class=GramE>she</span> will probably
have to grasp the smoke. <span class=GramE>In Cowper's poem (Vol.</span> I, p.
