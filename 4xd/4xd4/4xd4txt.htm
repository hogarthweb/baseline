    gin had risen rapidly, with over seven thousand gin shops in London and up 
    to thirty thousand people in the trade).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Londoners

    not only of the unrest that dogged de Veil, but of the far worse riots against 
    Irish labourers in Spitalfields that year. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And the picture of de Veil in his cups made it 
    clear that double standards still prevailed with a vengeance for rich and 
    poor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few years later, in July 1742, 
    three young aristocrats, including the bother of the Duke of Malborough, and 
    Lord George Graham (whose portrait Hogarth later pained), were caught in a 
    raid on a Covent Garden bagnio, ordered by de Veil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>They were released but the women with them, and others picked up in 
    the street, were taken to St. Martin’s Lane Roundhouse.<span

    morning four were found stifled to death, two died soon after, and a dozen 
    more are in a shocking way . . . several of them were beggars, who from having 
    no lodging were necessarily found in the street, and other honest labouring 
    women: one of the dead was a poor washerwoman, bug with child who was returning 
    home late from washing.</p>

    which service he was knighted in 1744. He was an intelligent and energetic

    children by four marriages and was also reputed to spend much time among the 
    prostitutes of Covent Garden, and so perhaps needed extra funds. (See <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Memoirs

    a burning link into the coach (another burns on the ground) and the butcher 
    is holding a mop in front of him. In the distance a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span></span></b>Hogarth has thought fit to present 
    us here with a night scene which deserves the name only by the position of 
    the sun, for we can see into the distance here just as well as at the three 
    other times of the day, and can even read the smallest writing on signboards, 
    mail coaches, and so on. In the first place, a bonfire is blazing in the foreground; 
    secondly, there is a hand-lantern hard by; thirdly, fireworks are being let 
    off, one of which is lighting: the passengers in the coach the way to the 
    grave; fourthly, these squibs are being let off by a boy with a torch which 
    sends its light into a deep recess and brings something to the notice of the 
    police; fifthly, a fellow operating at a barrel has stood on it his own candle-end 
    in an earthenware candlestick; sixthly, several houses are lit up; seventhly,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>the moon is shining; and eighthly, there is at the far end of the scene, 
    just behind the bonfire, a great mal-fire, that is to say, a house ablaze. 
    Perhaps a useful lesson on the consequences of bonfires. Thus Nature, art 
    and chance have combined here to lend the artist their light. Boursault, if 
    he had sought to explain this picture to his Babette, would probably have 
    said: 'Nothing is lacking here, but the lustre of your eyes to make day complete.' 
  </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It is the night of May 29th, when the restoration of the 
    monarchy and of King Charles II is celebrated by the supporters of that great 
    event (and who would not be among them?) with bonfires and illuminations. 
    That is why we see oak leaves on the houses here and on the hats, in memory 
    of the famous Charles' Oak which has become immortal. With that in mind, the 
    artist has chosen the scene really well, and with a degree of feeling, traces 
    of which are none too frequent in this work. For we must know that this is 
    the district of Charing Cross in London, where stands that masterpiece in 
    the art of bronze casting, the <a href="statue.htm">statue</a> of the unhappy 
    King Charles I, which is seen here in the background, and which our artist 
    thus, in a way, causes to take part in the festivities. Who among our readers 
    will not feel a longing for some future statue of the equally unhappy Louis 
    XVI being a witness to similar joyful celebrations? We must not allow the 
    impression which the artist's idea must make upon every person of feeling 
    to be obliterated by the pranks which he has put into the foreground. It could 
    not be otherwise at the public celebrations of a great and healthy people. 
    Every creature enjoys himself according to his taste; the butcher boys, some 
    of whom we see here, differently from the chamberlain, and the boon companion, 
    who is here too, differently from the arch-bishop; and in such an event the 
    artist who wants to represent all these pleasures will surely deal with them 
    most wisely if he selects only those which he can himself appreciate. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The <a href="drunks.htm">old man</a> in the foreground is 
    a heavily drunk and wounded Free- mason still in full regalia with the square 
    and apron. His forehead drips with blood as his mouth with wine. He glows 
    all over and would burst into flames had he not fortunately crossed the stream 
    of an artificial <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="chamberpot.htm">pisse-vache</a></i> 
    from the upper storey. He is being led home by the Lodge porter and candle-snuffer 
    of the society, who has taken charge of his sword, but left him the stick. 
    Such marked and re-marked skulls and brows as his are not afraid of a stick, 
    but against the sword wisdom itself would not prevail. The old man is supposed 
    to be the portrait of a certain Sir Thomas de Vale. Sir John Hawkins, who 
    had known Sir Thomas, assured Mr Nichols that there was no resemblance whatsoever. 
    On the other hand, Mr Ireland affirms that he very much resembles a portrait 
    of that nobleman, which he had seen. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Grammatici certant.</i> Enough that we see here a drunken Freemason under 
    the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pisse-vache</i>—but this certainly 
    is not satire upon the Order, at least not upon the true Order. It seems rather 
    to be aimed at the drinking bouts and gaming clubs which called themselves 
    Lodges, and with which London is inundated at every corner. Probably the cut 
    here is even aimed at that notorious house <a href="sign2.htm">'The Rummer 
    Tavern'</a>, the 'Roman Inn' where sessions of the Lodge were formerly held, 
    but the new sign- board which it bears, 'The New Bagnio', makes it clear what 
    sort of sessions those were. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The house on the left-hand side contains a <a
href="barber.htm">barber's shop</a> with a sign- board showing a head from which 
    a hand is just about gently to extract a tooth, if the tooth does not devour 
    the hand first, and the inscription: <a href="sign.htm">'Shaving, Bleeding, 
    and Teeth drawn with a Touch.' <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ecce 
    Signum</i></a><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>.</i> Through the raised 
    window we look into the shop itself where, in fact, two of the operations 
    which the signboard advertises are being executed upon an old head, namely 
    shaving and bleeding, with one and the same touch. The teeth are not being 
    extracted, it is true, but the nose of the poor sufferer is almost torn out. 
    The barber's assistant who carries out the execution is, as one can see from 
    the comb, a hairdresser at the same time. Comparing the fellow's dripping 
    mouth and his razor opened at a right-angle with Sir Thomas's mouth and his 
    Freemason's square, we are almost inclined to believe that he too belongs 
    to the Lodge in the Rummer Tavern and has only been called away for a moment 
    to minister to the old gentleman. And why should the old gentleman at that 
    hour of the night find it necessary to dispose of his beard? Under the barber's 
    display shelf a public dormitory is revealed, many of which could at one time 
    have been found in London; a true Thieves' Caravanserai where young and old 
    of both sexes with hen-equality and cock-prerogative publicly slept together. 
    Thus a 'Bagnio' here, too, and a third over the way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>On the left is the 
    <a
href="carriage.htm">Salisbury Flying Coach</a>, just about to rest from its flight 
    and to collapse upon the pavement, so that even the slowest and heaviest German 
    Diligence (sometimes it should more appropriately be termed a Negligence) 
    would have time to crawl past it. On the side where it has come to rest is 
    the gutter, and on the other the bonfire, which already seems to have caught 
    one of the wheels. The unhappy passengers had reckoned more upon some gentle 
    sleep than upon this dilemma, which calls for a quick decision, whether it 
    is preferable to be drowned or burned. The little rascal beside the dormitory 
    has evidently thrown a squib among the horses, and is now blowing with bursting 
    impatience at another. The boys in front of the coach are butcher boys who 
    are tending the bonfire. They appear to take a very cheerful interest in the 
    happy arrival of the travellers, and to welcome them to the gutter. One of 
    them holds the sort of mop with which one first swabs down and then dries 
    the floor, probably to swab down and dry the passengers with it. This instrument 
    forms a good contrast with the firework, like the gutter and the bonfire. 
    Anyone would think that with this the satire in the scene was complete. But 
    it is not even half done; it is only just beginning. Up above there hangs 
    upon a signboard the portrait of a somewhat broad, proud and pompous-looking 
    gentleman, and beneath we read his name, the <a href="sign3.htm">Earl of Cardigan</a>. 
    This is the inventor of the Flying Coach, who hangs here for the purpose of 
    witnessing the execution of his idea down below, and as it were to write the 
    epitaph over the grave of his own work. Others interpret it as merely a cut 
    aimed at his lordship's fast and sometimes incautious driving. But whatever 
    it may be, the lesson he gets is splendid. In a marble Pantheon his effigy 
    would never have had the opportunity of witnessing a thing like that. </p>
  <p>To finish with, a feature which is not easily noticeable but, once it is 
    noticed, strikes one as one of the finest touches in the whole picture. In 
    front of the statue there we see a cart with furniture. These are people who 
    want to shake the dust of their residence off their feet unobserved, and move 
    therefore at night; they are, however, unlucky enough, plan and details having 
    probably been determined some time in advance, not only to have hit upon a 
    night of celebration, and therefore illumination, but also to have come just 
    between these two fires, so that, as if by the fire-balls of a besieged garrison, 
    the silhouettes of their beds and chairs and their whole machinations become 
    visible some hundred yards away. Should they be discovered by their creditors, 
    they would not escape their 'Restoration' (293-297).<span
