    that the poor fellow is attempting to copy what he has been taught to believe

  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#314F44">Quennell:</font> 
    </b>Since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, it had been steadily increasing; 
    the exiled French Protestants had their own chapel in Hog Lane, close to St. 
    Giles&#8217;s Church; and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Noon</i> shows

    region.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several districts of the metropolis 
    were denominated &#8220;Petty France,&#8221; from the fact of the poor Huguenot 
    refugees aggregating in such spots, in greater or lesser numbers; and, to 
    Hogarth, their manners and habits afforded much amusement, and ample scope 
    for a study of their idiosyncracies (118).</p>
  <p>The old fellow in a black periwig has a most vinegar-like aspect, and looks 
    with great contempt at the frippery gentlewoman immediately before him.<span

  <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hogarth&#8217;s Graphic Works: </i></font></b>The chapel, according to 
  J. Ireland (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I</i>, 142), is French&#8212;in 
  &quot;a part of the town at that time almost wholly peopled by French refugees, 
  or their descendants&quot; (the Soho district). This would explain the French 
  mode in the dress of the beau, his wife, and (presumably) <a
href="frenchboy.htm">his son</a> (179). 
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#FF0000">Dobson:</font> 
    </b>The second [plate features] a congregation issuing at noon, on Sunday, 
    from the French chapel in Hog Lane, St. Giles&#8217;s (now Crown Street) (58).</p>
  <p><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg: </font></b>Of 
    Hogarth's hatred of the French there are certainly traces enough in this Plate; 
    indeed, it is all in all a rather murderous attack upon French faces, figures 
    and attire. When he starts on this subject he knows no moderation, and that, 
    alas, is the case here too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>According to the tower clock in the background it is now 
    <st1:time
minute="0" hour="11">eleven o'clock</st1:time> and the service has ended. The 
    door of the French chapel stands open and the spiritual flock is streaming 
    through, laden with the Word. Most of the members are so drawn and marked 
    that one would think some travelling charlatan has held his healing session 
    here and has just dismissed the walking sick. The chief male figure is evidently 
    a dancing master, in accordance with Hogarth's conviction that the main part 
    of the French nation consists of dancing masters. If he is not, he deserves 
    to be one. He wears a richly gallooned coat and a waistcoat, like a heavily 
    ornamented saddle-cloth, which almost reaches to his knees. The whole figure 
    exhales an incredible degree of tenderness and sweetness, in temperament at 
    least. He is posed in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pas de minuet;</i> 
    the left hand inclined slightly downwards, and bent back at the wrist, is 
    in harmony with the unmistakable expression of submissiveness towards the 
    lady. On the right wrist hangs a modish Spanish cane. The tip of the index 
    finger curves daintily towards the tip of the thumb so that they form a circle 
    far too delicately joined for even the finest pinch of tobacco, and rather 
    as if someone were to look at uncut diamonds against the light. Very fine 
    and expressive. He is trying with these fingers to spin the words still finer 
    as they issue from his somewhat broad, full and altogether not very charming 
    mouth. The gesture is not uncommon in pulpits and on platforms where they 
    try to impart to the useless coal-dust thrown out by the mouth, while it is 
    still in flight, the appearance of uncut diamonds, or to the yam which they 
    are spinning the appearance of spun silk. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The lady with the delicately though rather widely slit mouth, 
    through the intentional contraction of her somewhat extensive speech organ, 
    would seem to give her thoughts the appearance which her lover&#8212;or maybe 
    even her newly-affianced&#8212;would fain give his words with thumb and finger. 
    Though hardly two steps away from the church door, she already rests her right 
    arm upon his shoulder. This throws some light upon various things which the 
    crinoline is meant to obscure. Its rather queer and singular cut seems in 
    fact to have been chosen not so much for the sake of appearances as to give 
    relief through expansion, and to render equivocal the perhaps only-too-visible 
    increasing natural expansion, which is not in need of further elucidation. 
    The garment would fit any sort of waist, and again it would accord with the 
    ebb as well as the flow. It is also possible that it was meant to cover a 
    slight abnormality in walking, which the little heir from her first marriage 
    cannot disguise so well. I am speaking here of that <a href="frenchboy.htm">highly-decorated 
    young person of diminutive size</a> who, conspicuous with hair-bag, solitaire, 
    stick and sword, struts ahead of them. Or the dancing master might be his 
    father, who in that case could expect little assistance in his business from 
    his son's frame. But this is the way of the world: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Heroum 
    filii nequam.</i> That the dwarf, moreover, should derive so much pleasure 
    from the silver facing of his sleeve shows a spirit in keeping with the body 
    (282-284). </p>
