    of 1762.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The woman is headless; that 
    is, has no tongue, is no longer the conventional “scolding woman,” the shrew, 
    that popular effigy of the <span class=SpellE>skimmington</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In retrospect, as your sense of the sign accumulates, 
    you may realize that this is a man’s sign, in front of a man’s tavern, and 
    that to him a woman is not just is omitted in the sign—head, tongue, mind—but 
    what is included, that is, a body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This becomes the subliminal image of woman for 
    one basic impulse in man, expressible at this popular level of consciousness: 
    the “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>good</i> woman” is all body, without 
    head, tongue, mind, or spirit.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It was no doubt for this reason 
    that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> juxtaposed the “Good Woman,” in his 
    representation of it, with a “<a href="goodeating.htm">John the Baptist’s 
    Head</a>” on a charger inscribed “Good Eating”—the woman’s equivalent fantasy 
    of her husband (or rather the man’s fantasy of the woman’s fantasy).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This signboard design also hung in the Sign 
    Painter’s Exhibition (no. 33).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is 
    only in the context of these signs for tavern and eating house that we come 
    to see the strange kite hanging off the roof of the Huguenot chapel across 
    the way as the sign of the church: a mode of ascension into the sky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    has set up three parallel signs, as he has contrasts the opposite sides of 
    the street on a Sunday <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time>.<span

    this Plate represents the French Chapel in <st1:street><st1:address>Hog Lane</st1:address></st1:street>, 
    St Giles, <st1:city><st1:place><span class=GramE>London</span></st1:place></st1:city>. 
    That street, as well as part of the adjoining district, was at that time inhabited 
    almost exclusively by French <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>émigrés 
    </i>and their descendants. That is why the paper kite which is hanging down 
    from the church has been interpreted as symbolizing the people who were blown 
    across the Channel by a religious storm and found here a safe <span class=SpellE>harbour</span>. 
    <span class=GramE>But more of the kite later.</span> It must have been greatly 
    to the satisfaction of our good <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> that fate, 
    without any help from him, had driven the French just where he himself would 
    certainly have put them had it been in his power—into Sow's Street. For <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    cannot have had a more outright enemy than <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>; 
    a pig-sty and <span class=SpellE>Lutetia</span> Minor were synonymous to him. 
    Altogether, things must then have been highly <span class=SpellE>Lutetic</span> 
    in the whole of St Giles' parish. It should be noted that the floor of a church 
    there which had been built in the year 1625 was by 1730 eight feet lower than 
    the street, through mere piggery. This necessitated its being built afresh.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Of <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> hatred of the French there are certainly traces 
    enough in this Plate; indeed, it is all in all a rather murderous attack upon 
    French faces, figures and attire. When he starts on this subject he knows 
    no moderation, and that, alas, is the case here too. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>According to the tower clock in the background it is now 
    <st1:time
hour="11" minute="0">eleven o'clock</st1:time> and the service has ended. The 
    door of the French chapel stands open and the <a href="french.htm">spiritual 
    flock</a> is streaming through, laden with the Word. Most of the members are 
    so drawn and marked that one would think some <span class=SpellE>travelling</span> 
    charlatan has held his healing session here and has just dismissed the walking 
    sick. The chief male figure is evidently a dancing master, in accordance with 
    <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> conviction that the main part of the French nation 
    consists of dancing masters. If he is not, he deserves to be one. He wears 
    a richly <span class=SpellE>gallooned</span> coat and a waistcoat, like a 
    heavily ornamented saddle-cloth, which almost reaches to his knees. The whole 
    figure exhales an incredible degree of tenderness and sweetness, in temperament 
    at least. He is posed in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pas de minuet;</i> 
    the left hand inclined slightly downwards, and bent back at the wrist, is 
    in harmony with the unmistakable expression of submissiveness towards the 
    lady. On the right wrist hangs a modish Spanish cane. The tip of the index 
    finger curves daintily towards the tip of the thumb so that they form a circle 
    far too delicately joined for even the finest pinch of tobacco, and rather 
    as if someone were to look at uncut diamonds against the light. <span class=GramE>Very 
    fine and expressive.</span> He is trying with these fingers to spin the words 
    still finer as they issue from his somewhat broad, full and altogether not 
    very charming mouth. The gesture is not uncommon in pulpits and on platforms 
    where they try to impart to the useless coal-dust thrown out by the mouth, 
    while it is still in flight, the appearance of uncut diamonds, or to the yam 
    which they are spinning the appearance of spun silk. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The lady with the delicately though rather widely slit mouth, 
    through the intentional contraction of her somewhat extensive speech organ, 
    would seem to give her thoughts the appearance which her lover—or maybe even 
    her newly-affianced—would fain give his words with thumb and finger. Though 
    hardly two steps away from the church door, she already rests her right arm 
    upon his shoulder. This throws some light upon various things which the crinoline 
    is meant to obscure. Its rather queer and singular cut seems in fact to have 
    been chosen not so much for the sake of appearances as to give relief through 
    expansion, and to render equivocal the perhaps only-too-visible increasing 
    natural expansion, which is not in need of further elucidation. The garment 
    would fit any sort of waist, and again it would accord with the ebb as well 
    as the flow. It is also possible that it was meant to cover a slight abnormality 
    in walking, which the little heir from her first marriage cannot disguise 
    so well. I am speaking here of that <a href="frenchboy.htm">highly-decorated 
    young person of diminutive size</a> who, conspicuous with hair-bag, solitaire, 
    stick and sword, struts ahead of them. Or the dancing master might be his 
    father, who in that case could expect little assistance in his business from 
    his son's frame. But this is the way of the world: <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Heroum</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>filii</span> <span class=SpellE>nequam</span>.</i> 
    That the dwarf, moreover, should derive so much pleasure from the silver facing 
    of his sleeve shows a spirit in keeping with the body. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On these engravings, the fashions of 1738 deserve special 
    attention, for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> is said to have observed 
    them very meticulously. On our lady the arrangement of the ribbon bow is <span
class=GramE>specially</span> remarkable. I do not recollect ever having seen one 
    placed so low, especially without a trace of a sash. Is she perhaps wearing 
    the three-<span class=SpellE>coloured</span> emblem of equality? It looks 
    rather dark behind that bright vanguard. The old head, which together with 
    the youthful heads of the two lovers forms a sort of blunt pyramid, is beautifully 
    contrasted with them. The expression seems to betoken some justified righteous 
    indignation at the <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span> of the pair so near 
    the door of the sheep-fold together with some unrighteous indignation at her 
    own in- capacity for anything of the sort. All seven heads are true emblems 
    of <span
class=GramE>an impregnable</span> iron dogmatism and an unction which has eaten 
    right down into the bones. With such as these let anyone try to dispute. It 
    would be like trying to turn back The Flood with a fan. Their faith, if it 
    was ever a living one, is now, at least, petrified. We need only look at the 
    face close behind the dancing master's shoulder, at the expression of the 
    '<span
class=SpellE>Dominie</span>' at the church door, and the woman in front of him 
    hanging her head. One would be mistaken in thinking that a hang-dog denotes 
    a man who hangs his head. No! <span class=GramE>those</span> are often very 
    honest people, but it denotes the sly, rarely honest listener who carries 
    his head on one side, with one ear pricked to overhear his unsuspecting <span
class=SpellE>neighbour</span> or to hear the little angels sing. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On the right-hand side, <a href="oldcouple.htm">two matrons</a> 
    are exchanging a loving kiss, and how fervently! Their <span
class=GramE>souls seems</span> to be quite fused with one another, and their noses 
    would follow suit if only they were less tough and corporeal. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Immediately behind these two matrons, a saint has posted 
    himself close to the wall. The sermon was rather a long one, and he still 
    has not finished. The <span class=GramE>troop</span> of cripples who move 
    into the street there turn their backs on us, and so we will let them go. 
    The boy or dwarf in the wig and beehive-shaped cap with his little sister 
    are really exaggerated, and a touch like that is only tolerable if it is sparingly 
    used and is besides accompanied by other touches which prove that one is able 
    to do better. But this is the least reproach to be <span class=SpellE>levelled</span> 
    against <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> presentation of that community. 
    French people are not all like that. Quite impossible! <span class=GramE>And 
    least of all, French Protestant <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>émigrés</i> 
    of 1738.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    had certainly no knowledge of that class of people. Wherever I have seen them, 
    I have never noticed a single trait which could have occasioned anyone to 
    depict them <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>corpore</span></i> 
    like this. On the contrary, they were everywhere an ornament to society, and 
    even the matrons were paragons, who taught how decent mirth befits old age, 
    and how mirth itself could become venerable thereby. They are English people 
    whom <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has drawn here, Methodists or members of some other 
    religious sect; English-melancholic bigots, drawn in chapel where the dark 
    sectarian sky weighs heavily upon the earth. Here is nothing of the rosy-<span
class=SpellE>coloured</span> sky of the French nation, a sky which, worthy of 
    adoration in that <span class=SpellE>colour</span> too, as promoting a rosy-<span
class=SpellE>coloured</span> view of life—yet keeps the distance necessary for 
    brightening up a life which in it- self gives little enough. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>If it was a Methodist chapel just after the sermon, on which 
    the kite is hanging, another interpretation would be possible. These religious 
    fanatics of great spiritual mobility are lifted up by every little pulpit 
    breeze and float upon it to the Deity, with whose essence they believe they 
    are uniting themselves; they tremble and glow and hear inexpressible things, 
    but no sooner does the breeze give out, than they drop down and remain stuck 
    at the next street corner. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On the opposite side of the engraving the artist returns 
    to his element and there we follow him with delight. First <span class=GramE>comes</span> 
    a house with a sign- board displaying <a href="goodeating.htm">John the Baptist's 
    head</a> on a charger and the inscription, 'Good Eating'. The two dog-teeth 
    of the lion or wolf which seem to serve as brackets for the motto are here 
    not so much symbols of parenthesis as the parenthesis itself; good eating 
    (for teeth like that, that is). In the <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city> 
    of that time, most of the houses had signboards, often without the slightest 
    reference to the standing or the occupation of the inhabitants. Perhaps a 
    restaurant keeper settled in the house when John's head was already there. 
    Close beside it on the house of a distiller, as indicated by the jug upon 
    the post and the wooden jars hanging round the wall, is a signboard with a 
    headless woman, and the inscription, <a href="headlesswoman.htm">'The Good 
    Woman’</a>. <span
class=GramE>Thus, there a head without a body and here a body without a head.</span> 
    How in England where, as in Germany, the best women always have the best heads 
    such a thing could have been tolerated, and still is tolerated, I fail to 
    understand.! The idea is not <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> invention, 
    for in fact this type of representation is quite common in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city> 
    and, as <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    remarks, is used especially by those who trade in paints. This I do not understand. 
    A man without a head, on the other hand, would characterize a distillery not 
    at all badly; for liquor puts spirit in place of the head, and spirits cannot 
    be painted. But this is not enough for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>. 
    In that house where people eat according to the true time, he causes a little 
    dispute about the food to arise between the man and his good woman. This is 
    taken by her goodness in so bad part that even on a Sunday she throws a leg 
    of mutton together with the vegetables upon the saints in the street. This 
    is quite right. For even if the food gets no better through the transfer, 
    still they will eat more peaceably up there. It is amusing to see how some 
    passers-by who either hear the solid blessing coming down from above, or because 
    they had been advised of it by the liquid blessing already upon their clothes, 
    suddenly take refuge below in the house, either to demand damages for stains 
    or to wait until the shower is over. One of them, happily enough, has a broom 
    on him as if he had come to sweep up the good food. </p>
  <p>In the foreground, to the left, just under the influence of the ominous head, 
    there is still more of the good food on and above the pavement. A <a
href="crying.htm">boy</a> has planted an earthenware dish containing a baked pudding 
    some- what too firmly upon a wooden post. It breaks in half, and in that moment 
    the pudding becomes good eating for a healthy <st1:street><st1:address>English 
    street</st1:address></st1:street> girl, who forms an excellent contrast with 
    the French dwarf. The figure of the poor devil who suffers this misfortune, 
    <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has taken from a picture by <span class=SpellE>Poussin</span> 
    on the Rape of the <span class=SpellE>Sabines</span>, which is said to be 
    in the collection of a <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Hoare of <span class=SpellE>Stourhead</span>. 
    Behind is a somewhat <a href="lovers.htm">sensual coalition between Africa 
    and Europe</a>. The girl, whose plumpness is evidently meant to offset the 
    flatness of the French lady, just as the vulgar sensuality of the <span class=GramE>negro</span> 
    the platonic whispering of the dancing master, has just fetched a pie from 
    the bakery. Through the yielding opposition with which she meets the efforts 
    of her <span class=SpellE>coloured</span> friend, part of the pie spills out 
    on to the street. This, then, is good eating for the third time, and he would 
    show a poor understanding of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> roguishness 
    who did not see at the first glance that the kiss here is served as the fourth 
    course. It is not for nothing that these two heads stand so directly under 
    the motto 'Good Eating'. Quite in the foreground lies a <a href="kennel.htm">cat</a> 
    that has been stoned to death—meant apparently as a cut at the filthiness 
    of Hog Lane; perhaps also meant to symbolize good eating, for the fifth and 
    last time (282-286).<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
