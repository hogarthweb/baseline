<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Although
lustful public groping is portrayed negatively, the situations in some
marriages are no improvement, as evidenced by the couple in the
&quot;Evening&quot; plate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, a couple
and their children make their way through a town.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a href="wife.htm">wife</a> has typically
been seen as the dominant figure in the family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> notes that the &quot;traditional
dominance roles have been reversed&quot; in the relation and that the woman is
a &quot;formidable personality&quot; who &quot;tyrannizes&quot; her <a
href="cuckold.htm">husband</a> (44). </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> and Nichols bemoan the husband's
loss of power, equating it with a loss of manhood, crying, &quot;God made him,
and he must pass for a man&quot; (222).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The <a href="bossy.htm">two children</a> behind the couple enact, as <span
class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> notes, the roles of the parents (44).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The boy's walking stick is strategically
placed between his legs, and his tears suggest the fear of castration, the
physical manifestation of his father's psychical emasculation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The castration image is continued <span
class=GramE>with</span> the broken tree at the forefront of the plate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This reversal of roles is a disruption of the
natural order where the father's governance of the family is a microcosmic
model for the nation's control, through government, of its citizens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sexual intercourse, aside from being implied
by the pregnancy and the presence of children, is suggested by the husband's
expression. <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> states that his look is
&quot;helpless, almost hypnotized,&quot; but his appearance is all too
reminiscent of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> displays of sexual
exhaustion (44).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In effect, this
husband, trapped by his children, has become his wife's sexual slave.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The unhappy pregnant <a href="pregdog.htm">dog</a>
also reflects the burden of childbearing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The wife is maternal and sexual-a threatening combination in the
eighteenth century.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ruth Perry describes
the separation of motherhood and sexuality in the era, stating that
&quot;Motherhood as it was constructed in the early modern period is a
production-geared phenomenon&quot; (186).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Perry cites Anna <span class=SpellE>Darvin</span> who states that this
&quot;utilitarian&quot; idea established women as &quot;natural resources&quot;
who were to produce children &quot;for the Empire&quot; (186).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The importance of this task &quot;dictated
that 'nonproductive' forms of sexuality were increasingly displaced and
devalued&quot; and, ultimately, motherhood served to &quot;repress women's
sexuality&quot; (186).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sexual mother
here is not only rendering her husband exhausted, but is entertaining other
lovers as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This infidelity is
evidenced by the cow's horns over the husband's head indicating his status as
cuckold. Thus, even marriage is unsafe; infidelity and female tyranny plague
the once-sacred union.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The public
fondling in the first two plates and the role reversal in the third culminate
in the chaos of the fourth, “<a href="../4xd4/4xd4small.htm">Night</a>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    imitating the excursions and airs of her betters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The theatre is behind them, and the tavern on 
    the left, its sign bearing the portrait of the philanthropic <a href="sign.htm">Sir 
    Hugh Middleton</a>, who brought fresh water to <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city> 
    through conduits from the reservoir at Islington.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> wit embraces 
    the “middling folk,” the shopkeepers and carpenters who traipse out to the 
    country on a boiling day, only to crowd inside a pub and blow smoke from their 
    pipes into each other’s faces, while the women in the garden eagerly eavesdrop 
    on the conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But for his principal 
    subjects the pastoral excursion has been far from refreshing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the <a href="pregdog.htm">dog</a> looks 
    as if he has had enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The heat has 
    made the stout woman’s face as red as sunset (in the print <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    used a red ink to make his point) and if she is Diana, she is not a virgin 
    goddess but the lusty deity of procreation, as her pregnancy and the cow’s 
    horns, peering over their husband’s head, suggest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her <a href="bossy.htm">daughter</a>, with a 
    fan to match her mother’s, seems to follow her lead, pointing forcefully at 
    the king-shaped gingerbread man held by her little brother, who howls, almost 
    tripped up by the knob-headed cane that his father has lent him for a hobby-hose.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are plenty of old 
    jokes here about masterful women and emasculated men, and perhaps some topical 
    allusion too, since there was much talk of the Queen’s influence over her 
    strutting little husband.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there 
    is a sweet realism and tenderness too in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> 
    image—look at the accuracy with which he paints the tired father carrying 
    his small daughter, his hands clasped around her <span class=SpellE>ruched</span>-up 
    skirt, as she rests her head on his shoulder and clutches his cravat in a 
    tiny fist, letting her feet loll free (306-309).</p>

    middle class, famous for its <span class=SpellE>burletta</span> and rope-dancers. 
    <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> laying his scene here is an interesting 
    touch since the paintings were intended for Vauxhall; as a contemporary poet 
    put it, &quot;In gay Vauxhall now saunter beaux and belles, / And happier 
    wits resort to Sadler's Wells.&quot; </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Heat and futile attempts to escape from it are the main themes. 
    The husband in the foreground has fled the city but cannot escape the heat, 
    or the overpowering presence of his wife, or the fact that he is a cuckold 
    (as we see from the position of the cow behind him), or the burden of the 
    child he carries. The wife's fan shows &quot;Venus detaining Adonis from the 
    Chase&quot; (according to Stephens, BM Sat.). The addition of the <a
href="bossy.htm">scolding girl</a>, besides offering a cause for the boy's tears, 
    creates a parallel with the adults, a typically <span class=SpellE>Hogarthian</span> 
    comment. Both males are henpecked, each with his infant and his fan-shaking 
    shrew. As there is no escape into the country, there is no escape into the 
    future either. In the same way, the men in the tavern try to escape the heat

    a spring in the parish of <span class=SpellE>Amwell</span> in Hertfordshire,

    several places of public entertainment for the inhabitants of London proper, 
    there is in that district a building known as <a href="sadlers.htm">Sadler's 
    Wells</a>, where in the summer plays of all kinds—comedies, tight-rope walking, 
    acrobatics, ladder dances and gymnastics—are performed before large and hilarious 
    audiences. The company, of course, is not brilliant, and it is not in order 
    to be seen that the man of standing will frequent it, but more often in order 
    to look and to find amusement, while his fine clothes remain hanging in his 
    ward- robe and he, in his workaday coat, removed from all doing and suffering 
    in the world of compliments, takes his ease here. There is something very 
    refreshing about the country-side, and the interpreter of these engravings 
    hardly ever takes up this Plate without being charmed by the memory of the 
    few summer evenings he has spent under that sky with his friends. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

    the sultry evening has essayed a similar experiment, and has hung a pearl 
    close to the ear, beneath the hair. But this seems to have been a mere mistake, 
    which is just about to be rectified; in a moment the pearl will be hanging 
    on the ear lobe. In one hand she carries the hat and gloves of her dear husband, 
    who in exchange carries the child, and even a part of the wife herself, who 
    has been weighed out to him by Heaven with so generous a turn of the scales; 
    for she really leans with the hand in which she holds the fan upon her husband's 
    shoulder. On the fan we see a group from ancient <span class=GramE>times which, 
    if we include the little urchin here in the braided hat, bears</span> some 
    resemblance to the present group. It is Venus and Adonis with Cupid; only 
    there they have made themselves somewhat more comfortable. Our <a href="bossy.htm">little 
    city Cupid</a> bestrides Papa's stick and expresses his indignation at his 
    sister who, with a face already old and a temper and language even older, 
    grudges him his little gingerbread man and wants to snatch it away from him.

    full of promise of everything good and beautiful? Cupid rides here upon the 
    stick of Adonis and wears a cockade in his hat. The idea of giving Cupid the 
    role of an ensign is not bad, only our young man here is a rather uncomely 
    ensign. Briefly, the boy is not a soldier and never will be. How would he

    with fresh water from the countryside. Between he years 1608 and 1613 he built 
    a canal from Hertfordshire twenty miles long, the so-called New River; and 
    that is just the water which flows past here and upon which the thirsty bitch 
    gazes with longing yet irresolute indolence. He lost his fortune in that enterprise. 
    His whole reward was a new burden; title without fortune. I do not know whether

    How many of them eat out of their hands all their, as they walk the streets, 
    and find their monument in the end, if they find one at all, upon a signboard! 
    Though, of course, it is not such a bad memorial, if the man himself was not 
    bad. If the houses feel that the name upon the signboard does them <span
class=SpellE>honour</span>, it will be there for all eternity. Stone monuments 
    are not restored once they have decayed; signboards are renovated again and 
    again and then replaced by completely new ones, till the end of time. I really 
    think that this is a way to immortality, and since 'German' was always a synonym 
    for 'good and cheap', a Pantheon on signboards could truly be called a German 
    Pantheon. You may smile at this, but I am quite serious. What could be more 
    <span class=SpellE>honourable</span> than to look down through the centuries 
    from an inn signboard upon posterity passing in and out beneath, or to be 
    looked up to by them? I can foresee, of course, that the idea will be ridiculed, 
    but that is only because it is a good one. Few people can make a clever face 
    when they look into the sun. Would it be any worse to lodge in the 'Herr von

    scholar than to the king? I should like to hear somebody tell me that, if 
    he has the courage, and I should like to see the learned man who would feel 
    ashamed to fill the place which up to now even the emperors and kings of the 
    earth with their crown princes and crowns; which the golden angels; the sun, 
    the moon and the stars; the kings of the animals and of the countryside; the 
    eagle with single and double head, the lion with single and double tail, and 
    the horse sometimes with none at all; which the rose and the lily of the field, 
    as well as the French ones, in all their magnificence, have not disdained 
    to occupy. Did they not hang up whole towns, <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>, 
    Paris and <st1:place>Constantinople</st1:place>, to <span class=SpellE>honour</span> 
    them with all their inhabitants? One should not object here that signboards 
    also show waves, oxen, goats and Moors, who obviously belong among the apes; 
    snakes and dragons and geese,' who, even if they were made of gold, still 
    remain geese. This is no objection for this was ever the way of the world 
    with all marks of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>--with marble monuments 
    and order ribbons, with letters of nobility and doctor diplomas, with titles 
    and surrogate titles, and will ever be until the end of recorded time, who 
    is the mother of us all. Did not the Devil himself in the shape of the last 
    Duke of Orleans wear the Order of the Holy Ghost? Perhaps in this way the 
    German inns will improve a little, at last. Some of them are still in a pretty 
    bad state. What we need is a German Howard who will do for inns what the English 
    Howard1 has done for prisons. </p>

    </span>I would not advise a marble one: one can foresee that eventually it 
    would become a stony company of Germans which would not be of much more value 
    than our papery one; even less, for it seems to me it is quite a question 
    whether there are any other monuments at all in the world except papery ones, 
    since tradition has ceded all her privileges to the printing presses, and 
    now in its second childhood carries on a not quite honest traffic on the principle 
    that one hand washes the other. I think the question must be answered in the 
    negative. Even the eternal monuments which our fellow men have erected to 
    themselves upon the rocks of the moon and the borders of the universe through 
    new planets with new satellites, and on the path of the planets and comets, 
    would be nothing without their paper certificates attached. Alexander would 
    be forgotten like every other highway robber, had it not occurred to a writer 
    to make him a testimonial about his commonplace exploits which, constantly 
    renewed and embellished, continues to circulate throughout the world. On the 
    road to the temple of eternal fame, a man may help himself along to the first 
    few post-stations by means of gold and silver, etc., but whoever would continue 
    his journey cannot do so without genuine paper money. Now let us keep in mind 
    what paper signifies! A field of flax, what a prospect! What is not latent 
    here, as a physicist would say! Oh! <span
class=GramE>whoever</span> goes past such a field, be it on horse- back or on 
    foot, he should doff his hat and ponder, not only on latent cuffs for his 
    shirts, but on immortality too. If one wants to do something more, then I 
    should advise signboards, for besides the publicity of marble, they possess 
    all the imperishableness of paper. <span class=GramE>So much for the signboard 
    of this inn, and now a few words about the inn itself.</span> </p>
  <p>Through the raised window we see that it is not a very brilliant company 
    which is here, with one accord, employing Dr Johnson's remedy against suicide. 
    The droll aspect of it is (for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> does nothing 
    without point) that these people have left a smoky town with the express intention 
    of enjoying the country air, and have now shut themselves up in a smoky room. 
    Those at the window have certainly the best seats here; one may reckon on 
    a dozen others being behind them. For even at the cool window they feel so 
    hot that they have taken off their wigs and have tied their handkerchiefs 
    round their shaved heads. Outside the house is a man in such a position near 
    the vine that he has drawn upon himself the attention of an inquisitive laundry 
    girl. This class of people, the whole world over, will always poke their noses 
    into things which have nothing to do with laundering, and which they do not 
    understand. The meaning of the woman with the shoe in the background is, to 
    tell the truth, not quite clear to me. The interpreters all glide over it, 
    as if they had not noticed her, with the exception of <span class=SpellE>Trusler</span>, 
    and he makes a remark which is not very plausible as far as I can see, namely 
    'that the woman behind is stretching the shoe of the girl (the elder daughter), 
    shows that she is just as tired as the boy'. The reader will feel that there 
    is nothing whatever to this. But there is surely something behind it. The 
    English speak of a horseshoe, and, if a horse has already been mentioned, 
    of just a shoe. If now, in addition, they had a certain saying, very common 
    in German, about the horseshoe and its loss, then this female shoe may well 
    have been lost, and such a thing could easily happen at Sadler's Wells, especially 
    if one is accustomed to wear one's shoes somewhat lightly. (287-292)</p>
