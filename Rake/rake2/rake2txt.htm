    </span>This intimates the violent rage of the fashionable world for that most 
    frivolous of all amusements, the Italian Opera.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>The taste which our prodigal has imbibed for the turf is pointed out 
    by the jockey presenting a silver punchbowl, which one of his horses is supposed 
    to have won; his passion for another royal amusement, by the portrait of two 
    fighting-cocks, hung up as the ornaments of his saloon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A picture which he has placed between them bears 
    a whimsical allusion; it is the “<a href="pic1.htm">Judgment of Paris</a>.”<span

    persons as are general attendants in the ante-chamber of a dissipated man 
    of fashion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The whole is a high-wrought

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of the expression 
    in this print we cannot speak more highly than it deserves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every character is marked with its proper and 
    discriminative stamp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been said 
    by a very judicious critic (The Reverend Mr. Gilpin), from whom it is not 
    easy to differ, without being wrong, that the hero of this history, in the 
    first plate of the series, is unmeaning; and in the second, ungraceful.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fact is admitted; but, for so delineating 
    him, the author is entitled to our praise rather than our censure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rakewell’s whole conduct proves he was a fool, 
    and at that time he had not learned how to perform an artificial character; 
    he therefore looks as he is, unmeaning and uninformed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in the second plate he is ungraceful—granted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>The ill-educated son of so avaricious a father could not have been 
    introduced into very good company; and though, by the different teachers who 
    surround him, it evidently appears he wishes to assume the character of a 
    gentleman, his internal feelings tell him he has not attained it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Under that consciousness, he is properly and naturally represented 
    as ungraceful and embarrassed in his new situation.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The light, 
    it must be acknowledged, is very ill distributed, and the figures most inartificially 
    grouped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To infer from hence, with 
    Mr. Gilpin, that the artist was at a loss how to group them, is not quite 
    fair: his others compositions prove that he was not ignorant of the art, but 
    in many of them he has been inattentive to it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this he may have introduced in his print 
    figures which were not inserted in the sketch, merely because they were appropriate 
    to his story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The expression of the 
    actors in his drama was always his leading object; composition he considered 
    as secondary, and was little solicitous about their situation on the stage 
    (128-132).</p>

    after all, <span class=GramE>so</span> rare as one might think. One only has 
    to look at it from the right angle. Hogarth, who in presenting the truth had 
    to employ the language of pictures, could hardly have achieved his object 
    otherwise if he wanted to express clearly what happens in many a scholar's 
    head every day although invisibly, yet all the more encyclopaedically. A Jacob 
    asleep is easily painted; if, however, one wants to paint him dreaming of 
    the ladder to Heaven, I cannot see any other way out of the difficulty than, 
    as in Weigel’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Illustrated Bible,</i> 
    to stand the ladder beside him let it lean upon the clouds above, and thus 
    to let the angels climb it up and down What I really want to say is this: 
    if many a head which appears to be silently following instruction were to 
    be depicted with all the little angels that were occupying it at the time, 
    and to whom it was giving audience the result would be not like Jacob's ladder, 
    but—like <i

    more closely for they really deserve it, and we shall identify them as far

text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The man in the (probably) 
    dark brown overcoat with whom Rakewell is conversing and at the sight of whom 
    it is almost impossible to avoid thinking of cannons or powder and lead, is 
    a so-called <a href="assassin.htm">Bravo a fire-eater</a>, who against a small 
    consideration strikes blows for others and occasionally, as we see from the 
    plaster on his nose, receives them too The letter which Rakewell has in his 
    hand is a letter of recommendation which that man has just handed to him, 
    and whose content is as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>‘The Capt is a Man 
    of Honour; his sword may serve you.’ ‘Are you the Captain?' Rakewell seems 
    to ask. 'Yes,' is the reply; 'I, I am the man, upon which he puts his right 
    hand to his sword, and his left upon what is assumed to be the seat of honour, 
    in whose cause alone he would draw it, as well as the source of the courage 
    and strength with which he would wield it once it was drawn. It is, however, 
    worth noting that the letter is signed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>William 
    Stab,</i> which is about the equivalent of William Knife-thrust. From this 
    one would be inclined to conclude that the Captain was a man who, to save 
    his employers' honour, sometimes used other blades which were not quite so 
    long as the one hanging by his side and not worn so low either, but somewhat 
    nearer the seat of courage and below overcoats. Roucquet in his booklet finds 
    fault with our artist for introducing this character here, since he is not 
    an English type, but an Italian, and it seems to me Roucquet was right. In 
    the peculiar character of the English nation there is nothing of the bandit, 
    be he employer or employed, even in the lowest stratum of the people; though 
    there are of course people everywhere who will do a special job for money 
    on occasion But evidently Hogarth's meaning was not as sinister as all that 
    He probably only wanted to say: the young fellow here in his nightcap and 
    slippers counts poltroonery among his other manly virtues; his honour has 
    recently received a blemish which must be erased by the sword and in such 
    a predicament a Second who, for a small consideration, would do something 
    special, or who in the guise of a father or guardian would take the whole 
    matter upon himself, would indeed be of value. In a word our hero appears 
    to have received from Nature, together with his womanish face, that charming 
    need for protection of the defenceless sex, so that his heart is impressed 
    by nothing more easily than by the insignia of protection and <span class=GramE>security,</span> 
    sash and ruff, together with whiskers. Thus the scene between Rakewell and 
    the Jingo which at the first glance looked so bandit-like becomes at once 
    a sort of marriage pact. Why should not two hearts of the same sex unite for 
    protection and attack, and become one whole just as two of opposite sex unite 
    for protection and love; <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deux courages comme deux coeurs?</i> An interpreter 
    must halt when he comes as far as this with a difficult locum—enough of it. 
  </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind the Bravo stands the <a href="huntsman.htm">French-horn 
    player</a>, with his left hand in his trouser pocket. The Captain's letter 
    of recommendation is certainly enhanced by the heroic hunting call which the 
    horn player produces Music acts on the relationship of souls like warmth on 
    the physical body It expands and refines through expansion; those who had 
    hitherto re- pulsed one another or had lain beside one another in lifeless 
    contact be- gin to mingle their more subtle matter, and in the end the whole 
    flows together. Marriages are made in Heaven, so they say; one should say— 
    m Heaven, but if it does not come off there, in dance-halls and music-halls 
    <span class=GramE>That</span> horn-player is certainly drawn from Nature. 
    Hogarth must have seen a man blowing his horn just like that, keeping his 
    hand in his trousers, and having the lower part of his coat buttoned up to 
    hide this Perhaps Hogarth did not know himself the reason for that attitude. 
    But I remember having seen in my youth a horn-player standing just like that 
    when he was blowing, and I knew for certain that he did so in order not to 
    rupture himself. The purpose of the position of his hand was unmistakable; 
    for if he altered it when playing piano, he would always return to it again 
    at the next <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    before Rakewell in a sort of turkey strut with outspread tail is a <a
href="dancingmaster.htm">French dancing- master</a> of those days, and undoubtedly 
    some grand and eccentric personage. As one can see, he is uplifted by the 
    enthusiasm and the in- flammable temper of his nation, and only just touches 
    the ground with his toes. Some consider the figure exaggerated, and wrongly 
    drawn as well. But where is the dancing master, especially if he is, like 
    this one, so utterly lost in the spiritual enjoyment of his own being, <span
class=GramE>who</span> would not occasionally exaggerate and draw himself wrongly? 
    It may happen to a master of the language of gesture, as it happens to many 
    masters of the Latin language: they can no longer express themselves naturally, 
    through a surfeit of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>syntaxis ornata.</i> 
    That the left leg looks so utterly like a right one may be, partly, the fault 
    of the chair which was less willing to yield to the fine, undulating lines 
    of movement of his body or his dress than the air for which those movements 
    were meant. The greater the refinement, the more easily can it be wrecked. 
    Over a little straw which the normal pedestrian does not even feel, a dancing 
    master may break his neck. This happy mortal (and that he is happy, everything 
    in that beatific face declares that is capable of so doing; the eye closed 
    to the outer world, and open merely to the images of Fancy, and ah! the little 
    honey-mouth slit across with contentment), this happy mortal, I say, is executing 
    bodily a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pas frisé,</i> which, however, 
    his inner being, unencumbered by shoe and shoe-buckle, and under the purest 
    form of never realized lines of beauty, contemplates with inexpressible satisfaction. 
    What peace of soul! To be sure, Truth itself must be amazed when it sees here 
    a pair of feet carrying their volatile possessor to the goal which he might 
    have missed a dozen times, even with Wisdom's own head upon his shoulders.

href="fencing.htm">fencing master</a>; a portrait. He is about to venture a lively 
    pass with his rapier into the air, and therewith to challenge that opponent. 
    The man is remarkable for his tragic end; on <st1:date Year="1734"
Day="11" Month="5">May 11, 1734</st1:date>, he was run through in a duel with 
    an Irishman of the same name, also a fencing master; he walked home from the 
    field of battle, but died a few days later from the wound he had received. 
    Of course, the same name, the same profession, and such a profession as that, 
    in one and the same town, may well have given rise to all kinds of bitter 
    and offensive confusions and nicknames. Since they were both privileged dispensers 
    of the specific remedy against offended honour, each prescribed it for the 
    other in a brotherly fashion, and in this way the evil was happily removed, 
    to their mutual advantage. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Although this man has here no adversary before him whose 
    thrust he could parry, yet he has one behind him who casts at him such a glance 
    as a world of Dubois could not parry, namely a glance of calm, quiet contempt 
    based upon a clear consciousness of his own lofty superiority. This quiet 
    adversary is the man behind there close to the wall, who with a pair of considerable 
    cudgels under his arm looks more or less like a third himself. His name was 
    Figg, and he was one of the greatest rowdies of his time, and without quibbling 
    over words, really a great man. With his fist he could have felled an ox, 
    and with his quarter-staff a whole menagerie of Dubois at one blow. This quiet 
    combination of the British athlete and the French fencing master is certainly 
    one of the happiest: the British firm, enduring oak opposite the trembling 
    French aspen, the cudgel of Hercules beside the rapier, and the lion beside 
    the crowing cock. How the strong-fisted Figg leans there against the wall 
    and looks down upon the droll fencing solo of Dubois, with an expression on 
    his broad, placid face which leads one to believe that not only is he man 
    enough to cut Dubois in pieces, but that, should it be required of him, he 
    would be quite prepared to devour them afterwards! </p>

text-autospace:none'><a href="englishmen.htm">On Figg's left, and in conjunction 
    with the Venus on the wall, stands the old landscape gardener, Bridgeman</a>, 
    with the plans of a garden which he is about to lay before Rakewell who, however, 
    is much too occupied at present with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>utile</i> to pay much attention to the duke. 
    This head, it seems to me, is clearly a portrait. How honest and genuine he 
    looks! Perhaps the most honest person in the whole picture, and on that account 
    he is being treated by the master of the house to his backside. A face like 
    that is really an annuity, though, of course, by now nearing its end. In nature 
    we could well imagine a little deafness or paralytic shaking of the head to 
    go with it. The artist has been reproached for putting here into the hand 
    of that famous beautifier of gardens and the first to banish from them the 
    cold symmetry of the Dutch, a plan which bears witness to exactly the contrary. 
    But how if it were just to indicate the young master's lack of taste; perhaps 
    he has already turned down a better one, or what is still more probable, suppose 
    Mr Bridgeman, who is evidently holding more than one plan here, wanted to 
    put his employer to the test? But this is perhaps too far-fetched. For the 
    purpose of a hieroglyph, the Dutch type is really more suitable than the English, 
    and the description 'Garden Plan' was not so necessary here as it would have 
    been under many a genuinely English one. Incidentally this excellent man is 
    also said to have been the first to banish the topiary treatment of trees 
    and hedges and to have invented the so-called Ha-ha's.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In front of our hero 
    kneels a <a href="jockey.htm">jockey</a> who in his service and with his horses 
    has won a heavy silver bowl which he here presents on his knees, probably 
    because, on account of its great weight, this is the easiest way for him to 
    hold it until his master has finished with his more important business. The 
    father would perhaps have forgotten his immortal soul for the hundredth part 
    of such a trophy. Upon the bowl itself are engraved the pictures of the horse 
    and jockey. Above are the words 'Won at Epsom', and underneath 'Silly Tom', 
    the name of the horse. This is the application which Hogarth makes of Rakewell's 
    Christian name, to which we have <span class=GramE>alluded</span> earlier. 
    His horse is called Little Thomas, and so is he; it is ridden by other people 
    to their advantage, and so is he; it would not allow that if it were cleverer, 
    and suffers it merely because it is a bit silly, like him. By the word 'silly' 
    the English denote good, simple-minded fellows with whom one can do what one 
    likes, and who do not know how to look after themselves; thus are somewhat 
    foolish. In some parts of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    the Thomases are called by the common people Tumme. <span class=GramE>According 
    to this.</span> Silly Tom could be construed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Dumme-Tumme,</i> which does not sound unlike Dun-Don, the name of an excellent 
    race-horse which the writer himself saw in October 1774 win against five or 
    six others. Don denotes the breed and <span class=GramE>dun</span> the colour. 
    Whether in that name Silly Tom there is not perhaps the faint sound of 'filly', 
    at least from afar, can only be decided by an English ear. Of course, 'filly' 
    means a young mare, and thus does not suit the name Tom, but in horse-racing 
    fillies are so often spoken of, and the name appears so often upon the programmes, 
    so many fillies are running in a race, and the name is so often found on engravings 
    that I have twice already known it happen that an Englishman trying to read 
    that inscription read 'filly' at the first attempt, being misled by the picture 
    of the horse. Nobody would readily imagine the name 'Silly' under the picture 
    of an English race-horse, so noble and lovely a creature which, in the scale 
    of animal perfection, activity, and sensibility, stands certainly a number 
    of rungs higher than other horses, and sometimes than the master himself. 
    The animal only seems to have been debased here somewhat by the artist for 
    his master's moral instruction. But I shall cut short this tirade lest the 
    word 'filly' should begin to resound in the reader's ear, at least from afar.

    Ravishers, very funnily numbered like violinists: first, second, third Ravisher, 
    with their abbreviated names following, in which surely no one is interested. 
    What gives relish to this idea of Hogarth's is, first, that these terrible 
    ravishers were probably all artificial sopranos, and second that in English 
    the word 'ravish' has the secondary meaning of 'rape', whereas the German 
    word expresses rather a forced abduction which might also lead to a happy 
    ending. To an English ear, the expression would sound rather like, 'first 
    Raper, second Raper', and so on. One might also think of a third meaning, 
    but one which Hogarth would hardly have hit upon. Namely, 'to ravish' has 
    in English the same meaning as ravir in French, to overpower with delight, 
    and in this sense Farinelli with his voice was a great Ravisher and Rayisseur, 
    especially of ladies' hearts, a quite definite expression of which we shall 
    find upon this Plate. These were the ravishers, now come the Virgins: Signora

    It is said that some lady in a fit of the then rampant Tarantism, enraptured 
    by the singing of the castrate, shouted these words aloud from her Box in 
    the Theatre. Such a creature would really have deserved the punishment of 
    Midas; everything she touched ought to have been changed—into worshipped gold. 
    However, all the ladies hold their hearts in their hands (one of them even 
    grips hers at the top, right in the flame) and this circumstance makes the 
    sacrifice understandable. They were mere Sunday hearts which some may even 
    <span
class=GramE>raise</span> to Heaven without incommoding their real heart in the 
    least. The satire is directed, as one sees, against the rage for Italian opera, 
    and is therefore very proper, only not nearly sharp enough, and quite incommensurate 
    with the genius of our artist. There is really nothing to choose between a 
    strip of paper with writing hanging down from the back of a chair like a towel, 
    or rising like tobacco smoke in front out of a mouth! If after a contemplation 
    of these ingeniously drawn heads one happens on so heterogeneous a device, 
    one has a curious sensation, almost as if (I beg pardon of the Fine Arts for 
    this simile) with a substantial roast the gravy were to be read out of a cookery

    figure is in- tended to represent some one then living? Opinions on this are 
    divided, even among the English interpreters, and no foreigner could decide 
    it. It is certainly not Farinelli himself. To such a figure no young lady 
    would sacrifice her heart, not even her Sunday one. It is impossible to find 
    any in such a creature. Put whatever you like on the altar for them, marble 
    or wood, but for goodness sake only youth, youth! And Farinelli as he sits 
    over there in Heaven really seems to possess that, since even in the microscopic 
    representation one can see that the head-gear is of a man not yet thirty. 
    A fairly common interpretation is that the figure is our great countryman 
    Handel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Trusler affirms this, and only a few weeks ago 
    obtained a written assurance, supposedly based upon the statement of a man 
    who claims to have known our artist personally, that it is indeed Handel. 
    Nichols is against this, but he bases his opinion purely upon an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>argumentum a priori</i> which Sir John Hawkins 
    once expressed to him: 'Handel,' said Sir John, 'had far too high a sense 
    of his own value ever to have put <span class=GramE>himself</span> into such 
    a position. <span class=GramE>That being so, the artist could hardly have 
    had the idea of putting him into the picture.</span> He must have meant some 
    other composer of operas.' The same argument is repeated by Mr <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>. 
    Of course, it may well be that the figure is not Handel, and as the matter 
    now stands, it will hardly be possible to decide it until Hogarth's own notes 
    appear, which, as I see from the papers, are now said to have been found. 
    But this much, I believe, can be said, that Sir John Hawkins's proof that 
    it could not be Handel is no proof at all. It shows but a poor acquaintance 
    with the spirit of satire in general, and Hogarth's in particular, to credit 
    it with so much conscience. Handel's figure, which our artist and a thousand 
    others may have seen more often from behind, seated at the piano, than from 
    in front, may have appealed to him. And therefore, just because it was familiar 
    to the public, it could stand as a sort of generally recognizable symbol for 
    music, like Bridgeman's head for the art of Horticulture. I readily admit 
    it would have been contemptible flippancy to have portrayed Handel's face 
    in such a scene, but as it is—it is Handel's art which sits here and not Handel's 
    noble and lofty character. The greater facility for depicting the likeness 
    of a man in that position, combined with the probability that many must have 
    seen him from that angle, deprives the idea of the character of a studied 
    intention which alone could make it appear malicious. But if it is indeed 
    Handel, then Hogarth has made ample amends, through the trailing manifesto, 
    for whatever offence he might have given. 'To this man here', the inscription 
    appears to say, 'is due what you, my country, are wasting on miserable sycophants. 
    If you would reward a foreigner, at least reward him whose melodies do not 
    enervate your manly feelings, but enhance them through their magic power, 
    and incite you to deeds which are worthy of you. As to the others— </p>

    there already, waiting for the bell to ring. A milliner waits with great resignation, 
    listening to some man's rather violent remarks. From the gestures he makes 
    with his hat we conclude that it is only a petty quarrel, possibly about precedence. 
    He is afraid of being number six at the presentation. Had the girl not come, 
    he might have been the fifth. He may be a shoemaker. Next to him, according 
    to Gilpin, stands a French tailor, and beside him a French wig-maker; the 
    one with a new evening suit upon his arm, the other with a new wig in the 
    box. What a tailor compared with the village Theosoph who took the measure 
    of the mourning suit! But then, this one here carries the garment for the 
    festival day of resurrection in the great world. Just as the other smelt utterly 
    of cobbler, this one here, despite some slight similarities in their faces, 
    is every inch the titular Acting Counsellor. Evidently both tailor and wig-maker 
    have made their way hither in a carriage. Who might that long figure be beside 
    the mirror? It appears to be a creature on half-pay, or even an unemployed. 
    He certainly has nothing to bring with him, except perhaps a few claims to 
    benevolence, and he utilizes the isolation which he has to endure among these 
    people for putting them into the best possible form. But now the poet! The 
    poet with the Epistle to Rakewell in his hand! He who cannot taste and feel 
    the bliss of that man who reads his own verse aloud, perhaps for the hundredth 
    time, has certainly never been himself a begetter of verses, and consequently 
    is a stranger to one of the greatest domestic joys with which Heaven has thought 
    fit to brighten the lives of all those who write in rhythm and rhyme, whether 
    in a garret or at Femey or Twickenham. Only see how tenderly and with what 
    paternal joy he gazes on his beloved metric progeny, lisping childishly back 
    to him. The right hand rests on his heart and begs it to bear witness to the 
    truth of his feeling; hand and mouth do everything in their power, and so 
    does the wig, for it is the very spit of the late Voltaire's. Did we not already 
    know that Hogarth wrote verses, we might guess it from that lightly drawn 
    poetaster's <span class=GramE>head.</span> Otherwise he could not possibly 
    have known that among all those in this world who offer sacrifices, the poet 
    is the only creature who mirrors himself in his sacrificial wine, even at 
    the moment when he pours it on the altar. However, what may seem difficult 
    to anyone else is often easy for the genius. The best comfort in such depressing 
    experiences is to believe that one has achievements of one's own which other 
    honest people would find very difficult to attain, be it only the gift for 
    writing such wise notes as these to interpret a caricature. </p>
