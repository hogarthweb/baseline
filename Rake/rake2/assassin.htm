    man in the (probably) dark brown overcoat with whom Rakewell is conversing 
    and at the sight of whom it is almost impossible to avoid thinking of cannons 
    or powder and lead, is a so-called Bravo a fire-eater, who against a small 
    consideration strikes blows for others and occasionally, as we see from the 
    plaster on his nose, receives them too The letter which Rakewell has in his 
    hand is a letter of recommendation which that man has just handed to him, 
    and whose content is as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&#8216;The Capt is
a Man of Honour; his sword may serve you.&#8217; &#8216;Are you the Captain?'
Rakewell seems to ask. 'Yes,' is the reply; 'I, I am the man, upon which he puts
his right hand to his sword, and his left upon what is assumed to be the seat
of honour, in whose cause alone he would draw it, as well as the source of the
courage and strength with which he would wield it once it was drawn. It is,
however, worth noting that the letter is signed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>William Stab,</i> which is about the equivalent of William
Knife-thrust. From this one would be inclined to conclude that the Captain was
a man who, to save his employers' honour, sometimes used other blades which
were not quite so long as the one hanging by his side and not worn so low
either, but somewhat nearer the seat of courage and below overcoats. Roucquet
in his booklet finds fault with our artist for introducing this character here,
since he is not an English type, but an Italian, and it seems to me Roucquet
was right. In the peculiar character of the English nation there is nothing of
the bandit, be he employer or employed, even in the lowest stratum of the
people; though there are of course people everywhere who will do a special job
for money on occasion But evidently Hogarth's meaning was not as sinister as
all that He probably only wanted to say: the young fellow here in his nightcap
and slippers counts poltroonery among his other manly virtues; his honour has
recently received a blemish which must be erased by the sword and in such a
predicament a Second who, for a small consideration, would do something
special, or who in the guise of a father or guardian would take the whole
matter upon himself, would indeed be of value. In a word our hero appears to
have received from Nature, together with his womanish face, that charming need
for protection of the defenceless sex, so that his heart is impressed by
nothing more easily than by the insignia of protection and security, sash and
ruff, together with whiskers. Thus the scene between Rakewell and the Jingo
which at the first glance looked so bandit-like becomes at once a sort of
marriage pact. Why should not two hearts of the same sex unite for protection
and attack, and become one whole just as two of opposite sex unite for
protection and love; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deux courages comme
deux coeurs?</i> An interpreter must halt when he comes as far as this with a
difficult locum&#8212;enough of it (203-204). </p>
