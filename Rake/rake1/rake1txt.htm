<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The Rake's Progress</span></i><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>, companion piece to the Harlot's
story, is more politically oriented and more ambiguously concluded. Our
introduction to <a href="tom.htm">Tom Rakewell</a> is after the death of his miserly
father. The dilapidated house denotes the austerity and conservatism of the
elder Rakewell, who personifies the verbal meaning of &quot;rake.&quot; Sean
Shesgreen notes that Rakewell is here explained &quot;in terms of a rejection
of his father . .. spurning the middle class values (duty, marriage, thrift)
that his father has lived by&quot; (28).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Despite
the attractiveness of these values, the elder Rakewell, has taken his
miserliness to an unhealthy extreme, perhaps symbolizing the humorless severity
of the Puritans. Shesgreen also notes that the elder Rakewell has desecrated
the <a href="bible.htm">Bible</a>, using it to make a shoe-an act of the utmost
literalness as he uses the book to enrich both his soul and his sole (28).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>To
rebel, young Rakewell adopts the licentiousness of the Restoration and slides
easily into aristocratic decadence. Already, his crimes are explicitly sexual,
as his lover (<a href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young</a>) appears with <a
href="sarahsmom.htm">her mother</a>, weeping and pregnant, in possession of his
letters which assuredly promise honorable intentions. Shesgreen sees Sarah as
another representation of middle class values, this time of &quot;good nature,
patience and loyalty&quot; (28). Tom's sexual misconduct is another rejection of
these values (28). Eighteenth century commentator Georg Lichtenberg notes the
three vices pictured with the <a href="coatofarms.htm">motto &quot;Beware&quot;</a>
and comments on the double meaning of vice-as both an object which holds
something down and as questionable behavior, both of which are excesses in
their own right (200).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    the two very opposite characters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
    plate depicts the rake spurning the middle-class values (duty, marriage, thrift) 
    that his father has lived by.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The miser 
    has died suddenly, and the cracked, bare walls of his office—it has no home

    already hang on the wall, showing vises (= vices) with the motto “Beware” 
    (particularly appropriate advice to the unheeding son).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>To assuage 
    his curiosity about the extent of his newly acquired wealth, Tom has opened 
    the closets, <a href="chest.htm">strongboxes</a> and <a href="papers.htm">documents</a> 
    of the elder Rakewell (a name suited equally to father and son).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The father’s diary records with equal value 
    his only son’s homecoming and cheating someone with a fake coin (“Memordums 
    1721 May 3 my Son Tom came from Oxford 4<sup>th</sup>/ Dine at ye French Ordinary 
    5<sup>th</sup> put of my Bad Shilling”).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Scattered carelessly around Tom’s feet lies 
    the miser’s paper wealth: “India Bonds,” “Mortgages,” “Fines &amp; Recoverys,” 
    “Lease &amp; Release,” and “This Indenture.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>A strongbox with a triple lock holds silver plate and money; it contains 
    three sacks labeled “1000,” “2000,” “3000.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>A famished, snarling <a href="cat.htm">cat</a> (the place is without 
    food and therefore mice) guards the chest.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The last 
    prophetic act of the miser has been to cut a sole for his show from a <a
href="bible.htm">Bible</a> cover; he has died before sewing the leather completely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Beside the mutilated Bible, a chest and a closet contain worthless 
    trivia accumulated compulsively over the years ; the include a broken lantern, 
    a shovel, a pair of shoes, an odd boot, two swords, a broken jug, a bowl and 
    wigs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Having long ceased to entertain, 
    the miser has stored away a spit and jack in an inaccessible wall compartment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

    (without lenses) hang near them.</p>

    light a blazing fire; a <a href="lawyer.htm">lawyer</a> (identified by his 
    baize bag used to carry documents) interrupts his inventory-taking to claim

    measures Tom for a mourning suit.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Already

    holds a ring; and <a href="sarahsmom.htm">her mother</a> carries love letters 
    from Tom (“To Mrs. Sarah Young” and “Dearest Life . . . &amp; marry you”).<span

    confronts Tom with animal fierceness (she resembles in expression the cat 
    by the strongbox).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tom, a childish-faced 
    person, callously tries to buy the mother off with his newly acquired wealth 
    as he postures to permit the tailor to continue his work without interruption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>He shows no sign of grief at his father’s death.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Hogarth’s 
    revisions of his plates are regularly pessimistic.<span

    Bible is absent, Sarah looks younger and less drawn, and Tom appears more 
    youthful, naïve and expressive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other 
    minor differences include a shift in the location of the dairy and the inclusion 
    of a bill for the mourning cloth (28).</p>

    second &quot;Progress&quot; is of the wealthy bourgeois who tries to ape the 
    aristocratic rake, beginning with the fashionable seduction and abandonment 
    of a girl--all this being at the furthest extreme from the Rake's father, 
    who amassed his money by hoarding. In P1. 1 Hogarth contrasts the father and 
    the <a

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Epistle to Bathurst</i> (11. 177-218; publ.

    over the fireplace (identified by the same fur cap that lies on the mantel), 
    &quot;raking in&quot; gold. Hoadly's verses under the print, perhaps with

    decoying women and terrorizing the town with nonchalant, demonic arrogance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>He is young bourgeois, first seen as a trembling youth with a fresh 
    face haloed in curls, attractive, open, innocent—and weak.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Like Moll, Tom is less a seducer than an outsider who is himself seduced, 
    ruined and killed by the city.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He imitates 
    the rakes but can never be one of them, not because his money runs out but 
    because at every state he is also shown as a man of feeling, who rails against 
    fate and descends into madness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 
    the fiery dark of the city, aspiring to beauty but sinking into filth, Tom 
    Rakewell could even be seen as a fallen “flying man”, a prototype of the Romantic 
    hero.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Although 
    he follows a man’s path, buying art, fighting, gambling and whoring, to a 
    large extent Tom is a curiously passive, feminine figure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Hogarth’s hands, the situation of his Harlot 
    and Rake have shadowy similarities; most of all, they are dangers to themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>The higher Tom aims and the more he spends, the faster and deeper he 
    galls, spirally inexorably from debt to the desperate remedies of loveless 
    marriage and hopeless gambling, down to the prison and the madhouse floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>This reads like another brusque moral tale of the wages of sin, the 
    hardworking bourgeois taking puritan revenge on the idle rich.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Hogarth’s mortality is more intricate, questioning 
    how far people are responsible for their fate and how far they are the victims 
    of others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the first scene, the 
    father’s notebook, lying open on the floor, notes, “1721 May 1 my son Tom 
    came down from Oxford”, but beneath this news old Rakewell has also written 
    “5<sup>th</sup>, Put of my bad shilling”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The miser may have foisted his dud coins on 
    others, but now his own “bad penny” has turned up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This follows and old convention of procedure 
    by contraries—the mean father followed by the spendthrift heir—and yet we 
    also see Tom as a newcomer to the city being measured by other for their use 
    (like <a
href="../../harlot/18/harlot.htm">Moll</a> in the inn-yard being eyed by the <a
href="../../harlot/18/bawd.htm">bawd</a> and <a href="../../harlot/18/man1.htm">Charteris</a>).<span

    scoops up loose change behind his back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By 
    his side, the tailor holds a tape-measure to his thigh: the scissors Moll 
    carried, as if to snip vainly at the Gordian knot of fate, are in the tailor’s 
    hands.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tom has 
    inherited a fortune but he is also the impoverished heir of a parent’s neglect.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a href="pic1.htm">portrait</a> above shows 
    Tom’s father “raking” it in; and as a <a href="hangingroom.htm">workman tacks 
    the mourning drapes</a> to the rotten woodwork, <a href="moneywalls.htm">hoarded 
    coins</a> tumble from the ceiling, on to a floor littered with mortgages, 
    leases and “India bonds”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is 
    no warmth here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The empty grate and 
    hold-all for candle-ends show how the old man scrimps on heat and light, shivering 
    in the dark in his old coat, which hangs behind the floor, and his fur hat, 
    still on the mantle-piece. (When he revised the plate Hogarth drove the point 
    home, including a <a href="bible.htm">Bible</a> with its leather binding hacked 
    out to sole the old man’s shoes.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His deformity was deeper than the lameness for 
    which he needed the crutches now leaning against the wall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He was also an emotional cripple who gave his 
    son no nourishment but gold, a hard and fatal metal, leaving him like the 
    <a

    coins.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet Tom

    filled the inn-yard doorway (Moll’s route “in” to society and its vice), here 
    Tom is already the insider—<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i> doorway 
    frames a weeping country girl holding a wedding ring, while her angry mother 
    carries and apronful of letters and false promises.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Sarah <a href="sarah.htm">Young</a>, the 
    seduced girl, is far from an insignificant nobody.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Out of mind and sight while Tom is surrounded 
    by sycophants or passing out in a brothel, she appears again as soon as he 
    is down on his luck, <a href="../rake4/sarah.htm">finding money when he is 
    arrested</a>, <a href="../rake5/sarahandmom.htm">trying to stop his marriage</a>, 
    <a href="../rake7/sarah.htm">collapsing at his suffering in the Fleet</a> 
    and <a
href="../rake8/sarah.htm">comforting him in Bedlam</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed in the paintings, as compared to the 
    reversed images of the prints, Sarah seems to frame the whole story.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her weeping figure on the left of the first 
    painting is the first form we see, and the same figure, with her handkerchief 
    to her eyes, is also the last as she kneels beside Tom’s collapsed body on 
    the right of the final picture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At 
    the beginning she weeps for herself; at the end she weeps for him.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Sarah may 
    be a fool to stick so loyally to this heartless loser, but she is also a nobody 
    who gains dignity by suffering so selflessly for love.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tom, by contrast, like his father before him, 
    makes the mistake of thinking that cash can replace love.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the moment he tries to buy off the pregnant 
    Sarah we know that he is doomed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Hogarth 
    believed that individual natures were formed by upbringing, and their expectations 
    by society, but he never accepted that his deprived them of freedom altogether.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Moll is shown poised between the dark-walled world of the bawd and 
    the open sky above the city washerwoman; Tom is poised between his money chests

    scarcely be said to live.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The gaunt

to the departed's Holiest of Holies, I mean his treasures and his lumber, his
Lombard and his Archives (for it has something of all these four). At least it
cannot be long since he who had tucked so much away here has been tucked away himself,

would hardly mourn for the testator in material which is rolled like that. Thus
the tomb in which noble riches and civic plunder had slept together in
churchyard-like mixture for perhaps half a century, awaiting their redemption,
and the heir who in painful expectation had long awaited their resurrection,
are both today simultaneously draped in black. They are mourning on the

normal'>vis-à-vis</i> those two women the matter looks somewhat different. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Duo cumfacient idem, non est idem.</i> The
story is as follows: the young fellow comes from Oxford where he had carried on
and had done everything that in Universities goes under the general term,
'studying'. With the call of the Last Trumpet summoning the parchments, there
arrived also a couple of aprons with documents, more properly speaking with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opuscula academica.</i> They are both
portrayed here. One of them belongs to a mother and the other to her daughter.
The former, as we can see, really contains manuscripts, and the latter, to
which the mother points, covers the forms to which they refer, and in
particular an important outline from which may evolve in the end a Rakewell III
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in lima directa. </i>The poor and, as we
shall see, extremely good-natured, honest and sincere creature who stands there
crying near the door had been got into trouble through the 'studies' of our
good-for-nothing. The girl's mood is well brought out. What is not altogether
pleasing is that she is already oldish, and could and should be more beautiful;
but the delineation of beauty was never the object of its analyser. She is
crying in the proper sense of the word, when the most intense pain and the
highest degree of inner suffering seek rather than find alleviation in tears.
Her face is not childishly distorted, but relaxed and disfigured as if by the
onset of a deadly disease. Oh! how much is going on in that wounded heart. The scoundrel!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>I said, she is crying in the proper sense of the word, for
as one knows, that sex can produce quite another type of tears which serves not
so much to give relief from pain, as to bring on the pain itself, if it is not
readily forthcoming. Here we are not concerned with that type of tears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The girl's name is <a href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young</a>.
This we gather from the considerable collection of love letters which the <a
href="sarahsmom.htm">mother</a> is carrying in her apron there. The romance must
have been long, or at least carried on very ardently. All that can be read of
it is, first, the Oxford address, then the formula 'Dearest Life', a mere <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>praemissis praemittendis</i> instead of Sir,
or My Lord, and finally, 'to marry you'. The artist has expressed the rest by
empty space; in the originals the words were evidently of similar weight. Thus
the rascal has promised the girl marriage. One sees, in fact, a ring in her
hand, which she had evidently held up to him with outstretched arm to remind him,
by this also, of his promise. But—it was too late to have any effect, and so
the arm sank down limp against the body so faithlessly abandoned. The apron
full of bills of exchange which that fellow had formerly drawn upon his heart
in his own handwriting, he is now since the heart has refused payment, anxious
to honour with his purse and he offers her, together with the protest, a
handful of guineas. 'I am sorry my dear (&quot;dearest life&quot;) to see you
in other circumstances, but then so am I as you can see. Here is something for
your trouble and kindness There are more young chaps in Oxford—You never
know—Just take that If you don't want it—very well then, I'll give it to the
lawyer and then you won't get a thing.'—Something like that must have issued
from the little open mouth. However, the money is spurned; at least by the
daughter--or her all is over. She is as little likely to grasp the money as
would a marble statue m church, weeping over the um of a Saint, grasp the tip
intended for the sexton who is explaining the tomb to the sightseers The
mother, though very much in the flesh, perhaps even too much so also refuses
it. Fists clenched like hers and supported by such a face do not accept money;
still less does such an elbow, the very image of repulsion You scoundrel, is it
on these scales that you weigh my daughter's honour?', she demands, and to
judge from her furious look and her whole attitude, probably accompanies the
question with a little storm of blessings and good wishes which for once, to
the satisfaction of morals and virtue will be punctually brought to
consummation. Three of that woman's fingers out of the four which are visible
are adorned with rings Perhaps she has put them on specially for the purpose of
this visit, whose outcome was unpredictable, so as to show that they were not
so destitute as to come for the money's sake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The young gentleman
listens to all this and looks on, stiff, with arm stretched out like a
signpost, and probably with just as much feeling He who could forget honour and
offended innocence does not, however forget to render small services to his
tailor, carefully holding back his coat-tails so as to enable him to take his
measurements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I have often heard
it said that the more a tailor looks like a shoe-maker, the worse a tailor he
is. If that observation is correct, this one must be a most miserable bungler,
for he looks exactly like a cobbler. If I am not mistaken, the fellow is really
more than half calf-leather. It also seems to me as if a sort of
theosophical-apocalyptical light were playing on the brow and lips as he
kneels, and this kind of beatification, even if it some- times occurs somewhat <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ultra crepidam</i> in other Guilds, rarely,
as far as I know, visits a tailor's face. Evidently that creature belongs to
the small circle of persons who obtained from the housekeeping money of the
deceased whatever they had earned, with 50 per cent rebate; maybe even in
specimens from the lumber room. It is by no means impossible that he who, as we
shall see, used to repair his own shoes, had, by way of compensation, appointed
the family cobbler as his tailor, who then followed that trade as an amateur.
To serve up a pair of trousers or a dressing-gown for the third or fourth time,
as many a German writer will know without my reminding him, does not call for
great skill, and then amateurs do not charge much. Our Thomas, who is sending
away even his 'dearest life', keeps Theosophus as his tailor, for the present
at least, out of childlike respect. Of course it is the clothes which make the
man.' But Thomas is not to be 'made' here, only to be draped, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pro tempore,</i> in black. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Immediately behind our hero, and in direct contact with
his upturned coat-tails, stands a table decked with documents, and with an
ink-bottle and purse served up on it. Both are dishes which a certain customer,
being at the time alone at the table, knows only too well. He therefore takes
advantage of the little quarrel about honour and shame between the host and his
'dearest life' by making for the best dish. He cannot be sure of being offered
it once the meal has begun. That cunning guest is undoubtedly one of the most
eloquent heads which Hogarth has ever delineated. He is not a Valuer, as Gilpin
believes, nor, as he thinks, does he just finger the money. Evidently this is a
relation of the Law, a latere at least, an attorney, or something like a <a
href="lawyer.htm">solicitor</a> and notary. Under his right arm he has the
green baize bag which quite unmistakably denotes that class of per- sons. They
carry their papers in it, and sometimes also they carry home in it some little
trifle out of the dishes served at repasts like these, to which nobody has
invited them. How could Gilpin have believed that the hand which belongs to
such a head would only finger money, or that his secret castles in the air
could be supported merely by the ravishing sound of guineas in other people's
purses? The idea in itself is beautiful, even striking, but much too finely
spun for our Hogarth whose feelings were true and strong, but not tender,
especially for an a latere relative of the Law, who has no feelings at all. No!
the fellow is a rogue. If it was merely a platonic fingering, his expression
would be more poetic. Here, however, the Rabulistic eyes are evidently on
guard, while the hand is filching. He steals, but, as one can well believe,
with juridical security, advancing outwardly with caution, and keeping subtle
hermeneutic in reserve. I would wager that if Thomas were to turn round and see
with his very eyes how his guest was slipping half a dozen guineas into the
baize bag, he would only run the risk of having to pay a dozen guineas tomorrow
for having seen it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Although the old man is dead, he it is, mainly, with whom
the artist makes us acquainted in this Plate. He lives here in his <a
href="pic1.htm">portrait</a> above the fireplace, and in his dirty deeds
throughout the whole room: everything that is going on here, one might say,
still moves in him and through him. The portrait is excellently placed, and how
subtly has Hogarth indicated by a small touch, which at first seems quite
unimportant, that this is in fact a likeness of the old man! On the mantelpiece
lies the original of the fur cap in the painting, and that hint at once throws
light on the whole subject. The spectacles hanging there belonged on the face
of the man weighing gold, and the crutches standing there were his front legs.
They are of unequal length, evidently designed for hemiplegia. On old buildings
props of different lengths are used; also the smaller one might some- times
have served as sceptre and Commander's baton for securing respect in the
household or, prompted by the spirit of discovery, as a probing instrument for
use in wardrobes, or for exploring other dark corners. Here, then, Hogarth
wants to say, he used to sit, here he put away his front legs when resting and
here he hung his eye-crutches when weighing money in his head. He illuminated
his nights when necessary by candle-ends stuck into 'save-alls', which we see
here upon the mantelpiece, one completely burnt down and one kept in reserve.
Probably these little lights when burning on chilly evenings represented not
only the most brilliant but also the warmest part of that hearth, which here,
somewhat ominously, wears a fur cap. The garment too, which the old man is
wearing in the portrait, looks more like a warmth-gatherer for an open Mail-
coach than a dressing-gown for comfort. Everything in that household that could
bum was burnt in 'save-alls', even the little flames of life of two miserable domestic
animals which we shall meet presently. Perhaps even the life of the old chap
had burnt down in this cold place. There was no doctor at hand to stick up the
reserve candle-end, and death thus quietly took possession of the remaining
half. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>People versed in allegory or in the stone language of
monuments will find, without my prompting, how much Hogarth has enriched both
by the arrangement round that cold hearth. Just imagine such a monument with
its candle-ends in marble; the portrait of course in bas-relief elaborately
worked out and displayed in some church, and then ask yourself whether any
words would still be needed to describe the deceased who lay beneath, or the
heir who erected it in his memory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The upholsterer by hammering in his nails has broken off a
bit of cornice, or a part has come adrift which had not been fixed firmly
enough. It seems to have served for hiding treasure which had the
inaccessibility of the place to thank for its security rather than its having
been firmly locked away. A very good, though not a new, idea generated by the
desire for safety. Dispersed money cannot be stolen so easily all at once.
Besides, subtle concealment has a secret attraction for this sort of person,
and capital tucked away in a warm nest, even if it comes no nearer to hatching,
is often more attractive than some other sort which, though hatching dutifully
every year, lies in the open where it is more easily exposed to a watchful eye,
whether of the righteous or the unrighteous. What I have called concealment
behind the cornice might also have been a burial on the upper floor, since
money, and especially gold, as we know, has a way of moving. The golden rain is
going to fall this time past the gold scales and the 'save-all' on to an old
Danae's humped back, which no doubt is better acquainted with other burdens,
with the attentions of the small crutch and the old man's hail of words, than
with this type of rain. This poor domestic animal which not so long ago in
Germany, on account of its honest face, would have been treated as fuel, is
here carrying an armful of faggots. A new wind is blowing. The present regime
has decreed, as one sees, that there should be a fire in the fireplace where
under the previous regime the air was always in conformity with the season
outside. From now on money is no longer to be counted out with stiff fingers.
However, gold is still moving slowly here, and there is still no Scottish coal.
An elegant and typically London grate, which should properly be fed only with
such coal, is about to be replenished with rural fare, with remnants of hop
poles and palings. </p>

their thousands, and in whose uncoined metal the day of redemption is
reflected, stands the other <a href="cat.htm">domestic animal</a>, the starved
cat, miaowing over the chilly look of the silver. Its footstool is a book,
probably a Prayer Book, and its left forepaw rests on little bags full of
guineas, marked '2000' and '3000'. Poor Ribs! Looking at you, who could help
thinking of the Arab who, like you, was about to die of starvation in the
desert where he had lost his way, when he unexpectedly came upon a
tightly-filled bag. He fingered his find. 'A thousand thanks to Allah!' he
exclaimed, 'Rice, rice!' Then he undid the string to find only a priceless
treasure—pearls! Alas, only pearls! he sighed, and in despair threw away the
useless plunder. 'Absolutely nothing of value in these boxes,' Ribs seems to

out of it, and one can clearly see its end where the Goddess of Fate had got
hold of it, together with a certain other thread, and had inexorably cut off
both. Upon the sole is a coat-of-arms stamped in gold, which properly belongs
to the binding of an <a href="bible.htm">old Bible</a> lying beside it, and out
of which the sole has evidently been cut. That can only mean: to trample on the
word of God. That this should happen in such a household does not surprise me,
since the true niggard will not tread upon anything else. But that his own god,
gold, should be trampled upon, that does surprise me. Can it be perhaps that
soles cut from Bible covers provide protection against something? Gout or
corns? Or were they intended for pilgrimage shoes? I do not know, but what I do
know is that a certain person who held religion and money in equal esteem, and
highly at that, once frankly confessed that he felt the braid of his Sunday hat
and what it had cost him, right down to his shoulders, even when going to
church. But now such magnificence, a golden coat-of-arms, in a place like that,
so utterly cast before swine! It could draw blisters on such a person! And it
is not in keeping with a miser's character. Had he patched his shoes with an
Evangelist printed on parchment, and his leathern breeches with the Book of
Wisdom itself, I should not have wasted a word on it. But here we have
evidently a case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lèse-majesté</i>
towards the only being he worships. That is unthinkable. It is said that on the
earliest prints this queer touch is missing. I am too little acquainted with
English heraldry, and with the book-plates of English book-collectors, to
decide whether our unfathomable satirist intended by this feature to pay a
compliment to some aristocrat, of the kind made to the well-known Mr Tw. . . in
Ireland, after he had spoken disparagingly of that country in his published
Travels. Dainty sacrificial bowls for the service of Cloacina were made with a

and the 3rd of May that year been within the so-called Term, during which one
has to be in the stable. We observe in passing that this is the point from
which we learn that the youth's name is Thomas. An excellent use which Hogarth
has made of that piece of information in the second Plate renders it worthy of
remark. </p>

Evidently to give the young visitor a meal at which even the 'place where?',
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ubi,</i> had something tasty about
it; with a French cook. For although the common people in England, and even
many from the comfortable middle-classes, were of the opinion (1721) that it
was impossible for a sensible man to eat his fill in France, and that the whole
of French cooking consisted in fried frogs' legs and a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>soupe maigre</i> upon which they scatter a few drops of grease, a
belief to which our good artist almost fanatically subscribed, yet a French
cook meant a great deal to the upper classes; almost as much as the upper
classes themselves. But perhaps here, too, the name was everything, and the
French cook-shop was just the one house in the whole of London which, by a
certain law of continuity, ranked closest in quality to the Rakewell house,
where not only did they not cook well, but did not cook at all; where the
meat-jack sat in prison and the cats starved because the mice had emigrated. </p>

bad shilling! What intimacy between him and the bad shilling! How long may not
this single false shilling have embittered his possession of millions, the
mental pleasure of all his genuine, full-value gold! Perhaps he had been taken
in by it once, or had got it in exchange, at a huge discount, in order to
defraud with it—without having been able to do so. Thus selfishness and
self-love were long and equally strongly offended by that intruder. At last, on
the 5th of May, 1721, he succeeded in getting rid of it, and the event was
entered in the annals of the house with deep satisfaction, like the death of a wicked
wife. A single such touch would, I think, be enough<span

two of them already nailed up with a candelabra in between, without save-all.
The deceased, as we see, had three firmly screwed-down vices in his escutcheon
with the motto 'Beware, keep what you have' (except bad shillings, of course).
He had lived up to his motto. With the heir, if he keeps this rubbish at all,
the motto will soon be reduced to the importance and value which such maxims on
family escutcheons usually have. Family escutcheons contain only too often
merely obsolete claims to virtues and talents which the forebears had
possessed, just as coats-of-arms in their fields contain obsolete claims to
terrain. This sort of tool is called, in English, 'a vice' and, therefore, the
word means in an extended sense what can be gripped with the hand, a handful,
sometimes also a paw- or talonful. All this is very much to the point. But it
also means viciousness, and here I leave it to the reader's feeling whether
Hogarth also had that meaning in mind. It is quite possible. The natural
disposition of a people for wit, where those people are without proper culture,
usually finds expression in puns. The common people of London, therefore, are
specially rich in punsters. If, for example, Colonel <a
href="../../harlot/18/man1.htm">Charters</a> [Plate 1, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A Harlot’s Progress</i>] had driven through the streets with that
coat-of-arms upon his carriage, he would surely have found a moralist at every
street comer who would as little have thought of interpreting the three vices as
symbols of his miserliness, as of Faith, Hope and Charity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What has that man not hoarded up in his lumber-room and in
the box standing in front of it! It is all money in some form, but of a
somewhat high specific lightness. Here in a single bag lie 3,000 guineas, and
there a closet and a box are needed to house a few shillings-worth. (With a
ducat, so the saying goes, one might gild a strong horse, and a little shilling
may be a heavy load for it.) He kept raking in without caring very much what it
was. If it proved unsuitable for his little Eden, it was consigned to the
manure heap, without which no Eden can thrive nowadays. The position of the old
boot in the box at the door is rather curious. It looks as if it was the lower
end of an English coffin in which had been deposited ad interim among the
rubbish some old knight or other who was somewhat too long for it, or even the
old miser himself in the bedroom slippers in which death had surprised him,
until the proper coffin had been made ready and the room appropriately draped.
Now some questions to end with: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>1. What is the meaning of the letters PC (according to the
original they might be PG) marked on the box? Do they merely stand for a name,
or do they denote the erstwhile contents which would form a contrast with the
present ones, an opposite example of which we had in the jewellery basket of
the actresses? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>2. Just what is it that is lying jumbled up in the box? Is
the perforated piece an old finger-plate, or the folded cross of a yarn-winder?
And is the object hanging out there a one-legged tripod, or something else that
has lost its legs? The English interpreters who could so easily have found out
do not trouble about these items at all. And yet it could not have escaped them
that our artist has often concealed much fine satire behind such apparent
trivialities. Only think of the comedy texts in the Bishop's mitre<span
