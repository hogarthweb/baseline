    of love letters which the <a href="sarahsmom.htm">mother</a> is carrying in 
    her apron there. The romance must have been long, or at least carried on very 
    ardently. All that can be read of it is, first, the <st1:City><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:City> 
    address, then the formula 'Dearest Life', a mere <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>praemissis praemittendis</i> instead of Sir, or My Lord, and finally, 
    'to marry you'. The artist has expressed the rest by empty space; in the originals 
    the words were evidently of similar weight. Thus the rascal has promised the 
    girl marriage. One sees, in fact, a ring in her hand, which she had evidently 
    held up to him with outstretched arm to remind him, by this also, of his promise. 
    But&#8212;it was too late to have any effect, and so the arm sank down limp 
    against the body so faithlessly abandoned. The apron full of bills of exchange 
    which that fellow had formerly drawn upon his heart in his own handwriting, 
    he is now since the heart has refused payment, anxious to honour with his 
    purse and he offers her, together with the protest, a handful of guineas. 
    'I am sorry my dear (&quot;dearest life&quot;) to see you in other circumstances, 
    but then so am I as you can see. Here is something for your trouble and kindness 
    There are more young chaps in Oxford&#8212;You never know&#8212;Just take 
    that If you don't want it&#8212;very well then, I'll give it to the lawyer 
    and then you won't get a thing.'&#8212;Something like that must have issued 
    from the little open mouth. However, the money is spurned; at least by the 
    daughter--or her all is over. She is as little likely to grasp the money as 
    would a marble statue m church, weeping over the um of a Saint, grasp the 
    tip intended for the sexton who is explaining the tomb to the sightseers The 
    mother, though very much in the flesh, perhaps even too much so also refuses 
    it. Fists clenched like hers and supported by such a face do not accept money; 
    still less does such an elbow, the very image of repulsion You scoundrel, 
    is it on these scales that you weigh my daughter's honour?', she demands, 
    and to judge from her furious look and her whole attitude, probably accompanies 
    the question with a little storm of blessings and good wishes which for once, 
    to the satisfaction of morals and virtue will be punctually brought to consummation. 
    Three of that woman's fingers out of the four which are visible are adorned 
    with rings Perhaps she has put them on specially for the purpose of this visit, 
    whose outcome was unpredictable, so as to show that they were not so destitute 
    as to come for the money's sake (192-193).</p>
