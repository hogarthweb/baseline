style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hogarth&#8217;s Graphic Works: </i></font></b>Hogarth's second &quot;Progress&quot; 
    is of the wealthy bourgeois who tries to ape the aristocratic rake, beginning 
    with the fashionable seduction and abandonment of a girl--all this being at 
    the furthest extreme from the Rake's father, who amassed his money by hoarding. 
    In P1. 1 Hogarth contrasts the father and the son as Pope contrasts Old and 
    Young Cotta in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Epistle to Bathurst</i> (11. 177-218; publ. 1733; see also <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tatler</i> No. 249).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the name &quot;Rakewell&quot; underlines 
    Hogarth's point&#8212;as Stephens points out (BM Sat.), it is a name appropriate 
    to both father and son. The dead father appears in the <a
href="pic1.htm">portrait</a> over the fireplace (identified by the same fur cap 
    that lies on the mantel), &quot;raking in&quot; gold. Hoadly's verses under 
    the print, perhaps with Pope's lines in mind, emphasize the miserliness of 
    the father and suggest that the spend-thrift son follows as a consequence 
    and punishment (161). </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800080">Uglow:</font> 
    </b>But Hogarth&#8217;s Tom Rakewell is no Lovelace, no dashing blade, conquering 
    fashion, decoying women and terrorizing the town with nonchalant, demonic 
    arrogance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is young bourgeois, first 
    seen as a trembling youth with a fresh face haloed in curls, attractive, open, 
    innocent&#8212;and weak.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like Moll, 
    Tom is less a seducer than an outsider who is himself seduced, ruined and 
    killed by the city.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He imitates the 
    rakes but can never be one of them, not because his money runs out but because 
    at every state he is also shown as a man of feeling, who rails against fate 
    and descends into madness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the fiery 
    dark of the city, aspiring to beauty but sinking into filth, Tom Rakewell 
    could even be seen as a fallen &#8220;flying man&#8221;, a prototype of the 
    Romantic hero. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Although he follows a man&#8217;s 
    path, buying art, fighting, gambling and whoring, to a large extent Tom is 
    a curiously passive, feminine figure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 
    Hogarth&#8217;s hands, the situation of his Harlot and Rake have shadowy similarities; 
    most of all, they are dangers to themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The higher Tom aims and the more he spends, 
    the faster and deeper he galls, spirally inexorably from debt to the desperate 
    remedies of loveless marriage and hopeless gambling, down to the prison and 
    the madhouse floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This reads like 
    another brusque moral tale of the wages of sin, the hardworking bourgeois 
    taking puritan revenge on the idle rich (244).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Tom, by contrast, like his father 
    before him, makes the mistake of thinking that cash can replace love.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>From the moment he tries to buy 
    off the pregnant Sarah we know that he is doomed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   
    </span>Hogarth believed that individual natures were formed by upbringing, 
    and their expectations by society, but he never accepted that his deprived 
    them of freedom altogether.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll is 
    shown poised between the dark-walled world of the bawd and the open sky above 
    the city washerwoman; Tom is poised between his money chests and Sarah Young, 
    carrying his child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both make their 
    choices (246).</p>

    in his Epistle to Lord Bathurst:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>Who sees pale Mammon pine amidst

    first plate &#8220;Tom Rakewell&#8221; (the name, Lichtenberg points out,

    </b>More loosely constructed than the previous series [<i>A Harlot&#8217;s 
    Progress</i>], the story of Tom Rakewell is even more richly illustrated with 
    references to the contemporary scene; and once he has introduced us to his 
    awkward her, recently arrived from Oxford and endeavouring at the same time 
    to take stock of his patrimony, ward off <a href="sarah.htm">Sarah</a> and 
    her indignant <a
href="sarahsmom.htm">mother</a>, and <a href="tailor.htm">get himself measured</a> 
    for a new suit, he shows us <a href="../rake2/rp2small.htm">Rakewell holding 
    his levée amid a crowd of hangers-on</a>, who represent the various aberrations 
    of modern taste and sportsmanship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
    Man of Fashion is also a connoisseur; and it was against the vices and follies 
    of individual human beings, that Hogarth frequently delivered his most enthusiastic 
    diatribes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of his satires belong 
    as much to the history of taste as to the study of morals and manners; and 
    Rakewell the misguided Patron of Art is at least as important as <a
href="../rake3/rp3small.htm">Rakewell the dissolute frequenter of the <i>demi-monde</i></a>.<span

    formidable heads again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Signior

    the celebrated landscape gardener, and forerunner in that field of Kent, Repton 
    and &#8220;Capability&#8221; Brown, lurks disconsolately just behind him; 
    but a French dancing-master minces gaily forward, and Dubois, a well-known 
    French duelist, who is watched with sulky disdain by James Figg, the English 
    prize-fighter, champion of broad-sword, cudgel and quarterstaff, makes a fierce 
    lunge into the empty air.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A jockey

    </b>The occasion which Hogarth has chosen for the first Plate is immediately 
    after the old man's death, when the young gentleman has for the first time 
    obtained free access to the departed's Holiest of Holies, I mean his treasures 
    and his lumber, his Lombard and his Archives (for it has something of all 
    these four). At least it cannot be long since he who had tucked so much away 
    here has been tucked away himself, for they are only just beginning to mourn 
    him.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Here
he stands now, our hero, Thomas Rakewell, with a youthful, still healthy but
rather empty face; obviously more dupe than fripon one would say, to judge only
from the head; but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vis-à-vis</i> those
two women the matter looks somewhat different. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Duo cumfacient idem, non est idem.</i> The story is as follows: the
young fellow comes from <st1:City><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>
where he had carried on and had done everything that in Universities goes under
the general term, 'studying'. With the call of the Last Trumpet summoning the
parchments, there arrived also a couple of aprons with documents, more properly
speaking with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opuscula academica.</i>
They are both portrayed here. One of them belongs to a mother and the other to
her daughter. The former, as we can see, really contains manuscripts, and the
latter, to which the mother points, covers the forms to which they refer, and
in particular an important outline from which may evolve in the end a Rakewell
III <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in lima directa. </i>The poor and, as
we shall see, extremely good-natured, honest and sincere creature who stands
there crying near the door had been got into trouble through the 'studies' of
our good-for-nothing. The girl's mood is well brought out. What is not
altogether pleasing is that she is already oldish, and could and should be more
beautiful; but the delineation of beauty was never the object of its analyser.
She is crying in the proper sense of the word, when the most intense pain and
the highest degree of inner suffering seek rather than find alleviation in
tears. Her face is not childishly distorted, but relaxed and disfigured as if
by the onset of a deadly disease. Oh! how much is going on in that wounded
heart. The scoundrel! (191-192)</p>
