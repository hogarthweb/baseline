    Hogarth. But how does he show that the bride- groom did not find beauty? For 
    poetic justice to his hero requires this at least. Come, dear reader, and 
    look at the friendly angel who stands beside him; that is what he has found. 
    Now do you complain of the lack of poetic justice? On the contrary, I am afraid 
    your verdict may be: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Summum jus, summa injuria.</i> There will hardly 
    be a pair of hungry eyes in the world, even if they were specially trained 
    to look for precious metals, that would not recoil at the sight of that little 
    treasure, just as another pair of eyes on the first Plate flinched before 
    another little treasure box&#8212; Ugh! Only guineas! It is too bad. But we 
    shall see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It has been observed long ago that it would be much better
for ladies' adornments, and consequently for the ladies themselves, if they
were more intent upon the subordination between their two great dressmakers,
Nature and Art. But as a rule the latter, an amiable, ingratiating witch, is
mistress of the house, and thus it is not surprising if the other completely
withdraws sometimes, or else, when the former has finished with her flimsy
work, uncovers with one jerk, but with infinite subtlety, a little spot of
contrast, and thereby puts all art to shame. Thus, for instance, the head of
the bride would not have been at all bad if she had only let Nature have her
way. For though chance has deprived the poor creature of an eye, that in itself
would not have rendered her ugly, but now comes die above-mentioned busybody
and to improve matters she puts that omission, by means of a few stuck-on
beauty-spots, so obviously among the errata, that nobody can fail to detect it
at once. I challenge the world to tell me whether the pair of natural eyes that
stand there in the face of the bride like an iambus (u -) is one whit more
disagreeable than the sly, artificial spondeus (- -) in the face of the
bridegroom? Apart from this, one might apply to the remaining eye what the
English Aristophanes says about the eye of Lady Pentweazle's great-aunt:
'Although it stands alone, it is a genuine piercer, and procures her three
husbands for one.' Also, as it seems to me. Art could have been better advised
to leave her mouth as it was, without the quite purposeless u-shape. This is
the sign for short syllables. All right; but a mouth cut to the pattern of the
sign for short syllables is for that matter not yet a short cut. The whole
symbol is no use anyway. Had the first poets understood geometry they, would
surely not have denoted the long by the natural symbol for the short, nor the
short by the symbol for the curved and the roundabout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Although, in some
respects. Art has been somewhat niggardly in its dealings with that bride, in
others it has not treated her quite so badly, and this deserves honourable
mention. Thus, for instance, the circum- stance that the lady is almost two
feet shorter than her bridegroom, and only four fingers taller than her
chambermaid who kneels behind her, is a natural deficiency which has as far as
possible been counteracted by Art. It is only a pity that the ceremonial height
with which it has endowed the lady is not designed for the still, stuffy air of
a village church, but rather for a Zephyr in the Park, or the whirlwind of a
waltz at the Ball. We observe that she has the peacock adornment of her
lovelier part, I mean the feathered tail of her head-dress, swept backwards. In
a storm or a whirl- wind she would float along like a Juno. But though she may
add to her stature, thereby, this is neither the time nor the place for it. The
words of thunder &quot;And he shall be thy master' could fold up all the
splendour of the world, as could rain the loveliest peacock's tail. Some people
have found fault with Art for having left the bride's ear so unbecomingly uncovered.
Now I cannot see anything in this. I rather find fault with Rakewell's
peruquier for having so completely covered up his. At a wedding ceremony ears
are more needful than eyes; and then I find the little touch of vanity in a
half-blind person, especially one blessed with a somewhat suspect physiognomy,
in wanting to show that she has at least both her ears, very natural and human.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But now we come to a major question: is the bride still a
virgin?&#8212;or more properly, is the bride there a widow or not? A matter
which nobody else in the world would trouble about is often of paramount
importance to an author, and that is the case with us here. Were she neither
virgin nor widow, I would at least have to ask the reader to cut out a line
from the beginning of this Chapter where it was said that Rakewell was entering
the sign of Virgo. But it can quietly stay where it is. For the benefit of the
doubters in such a delicate question a miracle has come to pass, so beautiful
that if it is genuine, which nobody could well doubt since it is so beautiful,
Madame Rakewell's name would deserve to be honoured in red letters. On the
pulpit behind her are the well-known arms of the Jesuits, a sun with the
letters I.H.S., which have this in common with the Jesuits themselves, that one
can make out of them what one will, provided it is something good. That sign
stands here, in full conformity with its meaning, just above the head of
injured innocence and thus becomes the Virgin's crown. Yet, what renders this
miracle wonderful even as a miracle is that the connection is evident only from
the side where we, the doubters and sneerers unfortunately, stand! Just as
ghosts are known to appear, in the largest gatherings, only to those whom to
convert or to frighten they have left their graves. To believe and hold one's
peace is to be wise (236-238).</p>
