    EDWARD: FORSET: MADE: FOR: HIM: AND: HIS." As Nichols and Steevens explain 
    (Gen. Works, 2,123): Part of these words, in raised letters, at present form 
    a pannel in the wainscot at the end of the right-hand gallery, as the church 
    is entered from the street.--No heir of the Forset family appearing, their 
    vault has been claimed and used by his Grace the Duke of Portland, as lord 
    of the manor. The mural monument of the Taylors, composed of lead gilt over, 
    is likewise preserved. It is seen, in Hogarth's Print, just under the window. 
    The Bishop of the diocese, when the new church was built, gave orders that 
    all the ancient tablets should be placed, as nearly as possible, in their 
    former situations. (166-167).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#400080">Ireland:</font> </b>On one of the pew-doors is the 
    following curious specimen of churchyard poetry and mortuary orthography:-- 
    THESE: PEWES; VNSCRUD; AND TANE; SVNDER IN: STONE: THERS: GRAUEN: WHAT: IS: 
    VNDER TO: WIT: A VALT: FOR: BURIAL: THERE: IS WHICH: EDWARD: FOREST: MADE: 
    FOR: HIM: AND: HIS (It appears from an examination of the registers, etc. 
    that Thos. Sice and Thos. Horn were really churchwardens in the year 1725, 
    when the repairs were made. This print came out only ten years afterwards; 
    and the present state of the building seems to intimate that Messieurs Sice 
    and Horn had cheated the parish, when they officially superintended the affairs 
    of their church (141). </p>
  <p><font color="#800000"><b>Lichtenberg:</b></font> That it was indeed a pew, 
    however, and not perhaps a relic or a holy wardrobe, is proved by the inscription. 
    We give that here to save our readers the trouble of deciphering it for themselves. 
    It is remarkable for the 'spelink' and diction. THESE: PEWES: UNSCRU'D: AND: 
    TAN: INSUNDER: IN: STONE: THERS: GRAVEN: WHAT: IS: UNDER: TO: WIT: A: VALT: 
    FOR: BURIAL: THERE: IS: WHICH: EDWARD: FORSET: MADE: FOR: HIM: AND: HIS. Thus 
    it is a private church pew and not a wardrobe. However, since there is a burial 
    vault beneath, the matter is to some extent explained. Perhaps the pew is 
    half below ground and level with the ancestors, and would thus as temporal 
    sleeping accommodation provide communication with the eternal through the 
    memento mori or as a reminder of the Resurrection. Mr Gilpin has gone sadly 
    astray as an art critic in this picture. This often happens to critics in 
    practice. 'The perspective,' he says, 'deserves praise, only the church appears 
    to be too small, and the wooden pillar which serves no special purpose divides 
    the picture in a rather unsuitable way.' Mr Gilpin, usually so subtle, has 
    not taken into consideration that the Creed and the Tables of the Law on the 
    wall there and the face of Rakewell's sweetheart have been still more unhappily 
    divided. Had he enquired from the churchwardens, he could perhaps have discovered 
    the uses of the pillar. It served as a prop for the church and in addition 
    was quite indispensable for people who have a propensity for putting the revenues 
    of the church into their own pocket. The whole thing is drawn from life and 
    with a purpose which, if Hogarth really had the intention of expressing ideas 
    thereby, would conform only with a debasing and not an elevation of the subject 
    (243-245). </p>
