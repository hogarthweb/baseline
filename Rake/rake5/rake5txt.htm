      a <a href="maid.htm">bridesmaid</a>, and the <a href="tomgroom.htm">Rake</a> 
      himself, whose eye is already on the bridesmaid. In the background the pew 
      opener waves her keys in an attempt to keep out <a href="sarahandmom.htm">Sarah 
      Young</a> with her baby and her mother, who have come to forbid the banns. 
      The evergreens on the altar are appropriate to the perennial quality of 
      the old woman's lust and (as Hoadly suggests in his verses) to the wintry 
      marriage that this one will be. The encircled &quot;IHS&quot; on the pulpit 
      cloth makes a mock halo behind the old woman’s head, and the <a href="dogs.htm">two 
      dogs</a> courting offer a parallel to the human situation; like the old 
      woman, the courted dog has only one eye. (The male dog is supposed to be 
      Hogarth's Trump: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gen. Works</i>, 2, 122.) The dilapidated condition 
      of the church repeats the physical and moral condition of this pair. It 
      is Marylebone Old Church, which was almost out in the country and therefore 
      popular as a place for secret or hasty weddings. The inscription on the 
      balcony announces: &quot;This <st1:place><st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype> 
      of <st1:placename>St Mary</st1:placename></st1:place> le<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

      Anecd.,</i> 1785, p. 217 n.) notes that Sice and Horn &quot;were really 
      churchwardens in the year 1725, when the repairs were made. This print came 
      out only ten years afterwards and the present state of the building seems 
      to intimate, <span
class=GramE>that<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Messieurs</span> Sice 
      and Horn had cheated the parish, when they officially superintended the 
      affairs of their church.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
      ragged appearance of the <a href="urchin.htm">charity-boy</a>, who holds 
      a hassock for the bride to kneel on, comments on his guardians as the appearance 
      of the church comments on Sice and Horn. The <a href="commandments.htm">Creed 
      is torn</a> (or rotted) so that only the beginning, &quot;I believe, is 
      legible; the tablet of the Commandments from VI through X is cracked--significantly 
      it is the second tablet, which deals with &quot;Duties to our Neighbors.&quot; 
      The crack stops short, however, of the Tenth Commandment, which includes 
      &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.&quot; The opening of &quot;THE 
      POORS BOX&quot; is covered with a cobweb. </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none' align="left">The smear-like marks on the back of the pulpit 
      suggest the shape of the squat <a href="minister.htm"><span class=GramE>clergyman</span></a><span
class=GramE>'s head and shoulders,</span> and above these is a circular mark produced 
      by his custom of hanging his hat on a nail while he preaches (see <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Sleeping Congregation</i>). The clergyman 
      who fits these marks is reading the service &quot;OF MATRIMONY,&quot; and 
      his clerk stands beside him. The inscription on the pew at left reads: &quot;THESE: 
      PEWES VNSCRVD: AND: TANE: IN. SVNDE[r] / IN. STONE: THERS: GRAVEN: WHAT: 
      IS: VNDER / TO: WIT: A: VALT: FOR: BVRIAL: THERE: IS / WHICH: EDWARD: FORSET:

      their vault has been claimed and used by his Grace the Duke of Portland, 
      as lord of the manor. The mural monument of the Taylors, composed of lead 
      gilt over, is likewise preserved. It is seen, in Hogarth's Print, just under 
      the window. The Bishop of the diocese, when the new church was built, gave 
      orders that all the ancient tablets should be placed, as nearly as possible, 
      in their former situations. </p>

through the zodiac of his life. He appears to have made a fortunate escape from
the jaws of the British Lion of Justice, and here he is entering the sign of
the Virgin (Virgo). The sign itself is depicted, but requires some explanation.
<a href="tomgroom.htm">Rakewell</a>'s paternal fortune has gone, and the whole
conglomeration of boxes and cupboards and corners which we saw on the first
Plate may still contain many a little trifle for pussy, but alas! <span
class=GramE>no</span> longer anything for him. To fill that terrible void he
has opened up in the East End a small bartering business with his manly figure,
and this has prospered so delightfully that everything filled up once more. To
understand that business thoroughly, one should know that in the orient of London
live the true money-planters who concentrate specially upon cultivating its
seeds; in the Occident, on the other hand, they are more occupied with the
enjoyment of the plant itself, and have so little thought for the future that
families often find themselves compelled to obtain fresh seeds from the orient,
on stringent terms. It is just such a bargain whose contract is being concluded
here; only the conditions are not too strict; he merely has to marry, and the
wedding is now being solemnized. <a href="bride.htm">Bride</a> and bridegroom
have found what they each sought: she a handsome young man, he a rich wife;
what more does one want? That neither of them found what they did not seek is
nobody's business, least of all a motive for rejoicing in another's misfortune,
as I have sometimes found it among people to whom I have shown that wedding
scene. But they were quite wrong in this. A sensible man will express his
enjoyment of other people's misfortune only if he perceives that they have been
deceived in their hopes; but where is anything of that kind here? She did not
look for riches and did not find any. <span class=GramE>And he?</span> He did
not look for beauty, and so he found none. On the contrary, he found debts to
Nature into the bargain. This is the theme. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>That the bride does not, and cannot hope to, find any
fortune has been excellently expressed by Hogarth. But how does he show that
the bride- groom did not find beauty? For poetic justice to his hero requires
this at least. Come, dear reader, and look at the friendly angel who stands
beside him; that is what he has found. Now do you complain of the lack of
poetic justice? On the contrary, I am afraid your verdict may be: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Summum jus, summa injuria.</i> There will
hardly be a pair of hungry eyes in the world, even if they were specially
trained to look for precious metals, that would not recoil at the sight of that
little treasure, just as another pair of eyes on the first Plate flinched
before another little treasure box— Ugh! Only guineas! It is too bad. But we
shall see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It has been observed long ago that it would be much better
for ladies' adornments, and consequently for the ladies themselves, if they
were more intent upon the subordination between their two great dressmakers,
Nature and Art. But as a rule the latter, an amiable, ingratiating witch, is
mistress of the house, and thus it is not surprising if the other completely
withdraws sometimes, or else, when the former has finished with her flimsy
work, uncovers with one jerk, but with infinite subtlety, a little spot of
contrast, and thereby puts all art to shame. Thus, for instance, the head of
the bride would not have been at all bad if she had only let Nature have her
way. For though chance has deprived the poor creature of an eye, that in itself
would not have rendered her ugly, but now comes die above-mentioned busybody
and to improve matters she puts that omission, by means of a few stuck-on
beauty-spots, so obviously among the errata, that nobody can fail to detect it
at once. I challenge the world to tell me whether the pair of natural eyes that
stand there in the face of the bride like an iambus (u -) is one whit more
disagreeable than the sly, artificial spondeus (- -) in the face of the
bridegroom? Apart from this, one might apply to the remaining eye what the
English Aristophanes says about the eye of Lady Pentweazle's great-aunt:
'Although it stands alone, it is a genuine piercer, and procures her three
husbands for one.' Also, as it seems to me. Art could have been better advised
to leave her mouth as it was, without the quite purposeless u-shape. This is
the sign for short syllables. All right; but a mouth cut to the pattern of the
sign for short syllables is for that matter not yet a short cut. The whole
symbol is no use anyway. Had the first poets understood geometry they, would
surely not have denoted the long by the natural symbol for the short, nor the
short by the symbol for the curved and the roundabout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Although, in some
respects. Art has been somewhat niggardly in its dealings with that bride, in
others it has not treated her quite so badly, and this deserves honourable
mention. Thus, for instance, the circum- stance that the lady is almost two
feet shorter than her bridegroom, and only four fingers taller than her
chambermaid who kneels behind her, is a natural deficiency which has as far as
possible been counteracted by Art. It is only a pity that the ceremonial height
with which it has endowed the lady is not designed for the still, stuffy air of
a village church, but rather for a Zephyr in the Park, or the whirlwind of a
waltz at the Ball. We observe that she has the peacock adornment of her
lovelier <span class=GramE>part,</span> I mean the feathered tail of her
head-dress, swept backwards. In a storm or a whirl- wind she would float along
like a Juno. But though she may add to her stature, thereby, this is neither
the time nor the place for it. The words of thunder &quot;And he shall be thy
master' could fold up all the splendour of the world, as could rain the
loveliest peacock's tail. Some people have found fault with Art for having left
the bride's ear so unbecomingly uncovered. Now I cannot see anything in this. I
rather find fault with Rakewell's peruquier for having so completely covered up
his. At a wedding ceremony ears are more needful than eyes; and then I find the
little touch of vanity in a half-blind person, especially one blessed with a
somewhat suspect physiognomy, in wanting to show that she has at least both her
ears, very natural and human. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But now we come to a major question: is the bride still a
virgin?—or more properly, is the bride there a widow or not? A matter which
nobody else in the world would trouble about is often of paramount importance
to an author, and that is the case with us here. Were she neither virgin nor
widow, I would at least have to ask the reader to cut out a line from the
beginning of this Chapter where it was said that Rakewell was entering the sign
of Virgo. But it can quietly stay where it is. For the benefit of the doubters
in such a delicate question a miracle has come to pass, so beautiful that if it
is genuine, which nobody could well doubt since it is so beautiful, Madame
Rakewell's name would deserve to be honoured in red letters. On the pulpit
behind her are the well-known arms of the Jesuits, a sun with the letters
I.H.S., which have this in common with the Jesuits <span class=GramE>themselves,
that</span> one can make out of them what one will, provided it is something
good. That sign stands here, in full conformity with its meaning, just above
the head of injured innocence and thus becomes the Virgin's crown. Yet, what
renders this miracle wonderful even as a miracle is that the connection is
evident only from the side where we, the doubters and sneerers unfortunately,
stand! Just as ghosts are known to appear, in the largest gatherings, only to those
<span class=GramE>whom</span> to convert or to frighten they have left their
graves. To believe and hold one's peace is to be wise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Rakewell's figure is not utterly devoid of grace. One sees
that Essex can achieve something when he tries, so can the proposition:
'Quarter of a century younger and two feet taller.' In his eye gleams a sense
of superiority coupled with an easy contempt and dissimulation, with a touch of
the lover's roguery. Without that touch we could have spoken of Jesuit signs
here too. The ears we cannot see and the eyes—only just! But they themselves
are keenly focused. Their glance passes right through the bride's halo, without
disturbing it, on to a little item from the bride's Inventory, the <a
href="maid.htm">chamber-maid</a>, who, compounded with the rest of the Capital,
has evidently contributed to the completion of the bargain. The girl is
occupied in improving something in her mistress's Culotte, the Seraphin being
beyond improvement. In the girl's face we notice the trace of a hidden smile,
which leads us to think, not without reason, that the parson, in order to make
the bride a compliment, has refrained from eliminating certain words from the
wedding formula which are usually omitted when the bride is a quarter of a
century older than the bridegroom, who is just entering his second quarter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Before the bridal pair, like two liturgical clocks, stand
the <a href="minister.htm">parson</a> and the parish clerk; they are both set
at 'Wedding', the former being the regulator, the latter the chimer. The
English institution of parish clerk is one which will certainly disappear as
soon as Herr von Kempelen has succeeded in constructing his talking machine;
even now, one would think, a clock that could strike 'Amen' would not be more
difficult to construct than one calling 'Cuckoo'. One can almost hear the man
bleating his tedious 'Amen'. However, beneath that cold official mien one can
still discover a little glimmer of mischief. I fear it is about the
semi-secular feast which is here solemnized as if it were a Day of Dedication.
About the Pastor, Mr Gilpin observes, quite excellently, that everybody who
looks at him thinks that he has somewhere seen such a face and such a wig, but
cannot for the moment say where. It would be impossible to praise our artist more
highly in so few words. Eyebrows, eye, mouth (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sit venia verbo</i>), <span class=GramE>nay</span> everything down to
the very thumbs are cut as if out of one piece. The boy in front of the bride
who is occupied in pushing a hassock before her, since the kneeling down is
imminent, belongs, as we can see from his little collar, to the Charity School
of the parish. His miserable clothes demonstrate that the Director so manages
matters that the children do not forget how to beg. One never knows whether
they may not need to again. Jacket and stockings are torn, and from the shoes
peep not only the feet of the stockings, but the toes themselves. Since, as we
shall hear soon, this Church, and consequently the parish, <span class=GramE>are</span>
very clearly indicated, Hogarth must have known whom he had before him when he
dealt such blows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>If we let our eyes wander over the whole of this scene, it
almost calls to mind the prospect of a harbour on a rough day, where in the
foreground ships of all kinds lie peacefully at anchor, whereas near the
entrance waves are beating high, making entry difficult for newcomers and
dealing blows which, if the ships do not quickly succeed in reaching the open
sea, not uncommonly end with the loss of the rigging or even of the cargo and
the ship itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>My readers will have noticed that a violent storm is
really raging in the background here. The trouble is briefly this. <a
href="sarahandmom.htm">Sarah Young</a> has saved her abominable seducer by
sacrificing her little all. He promised her marriage for the second time
and—here for the second time betrays her. She appears here with the child, this
time in her arms, to protest against the union of her seducer with another
woman. Probably she did all this on the advice other mother who, to judge from
her physiognomy, holds somewhat different views about the ways of Heaven than
does her good- natured daughter. The latter surrenders to its will in the hope
of a better future; the former, on the other hand, is in favour of at least
trying whether, by the use of the fists which Heaven has granted her, something
might not be done already upon earth. She thus arrives here with her daughter
at the harbour, but as she is about to enter, and is already making headway,
they are met by such terrific breakers that the daughter is immediately driven
out again. The mother, though she tries to battle with the waves, and throws
out a five-pronged anchor, finds that such measures cannot help much here and,
as we shall see, they have in fact not helped at all. The Sexton's wife, or
some other aged pew-opener, well versed in the law of the Church, who may be
apprehensive of the Power of the Keys and of the loss of the stole-fees, seizes
a bundle of Church keys and, entirely contrary to reason and equity (and
specially the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compelle intrare</i>),
starts hitting out against the two protesting women. The daughter, gentle and
yielding and more concerned for her child and her mother than for her own
rights, compromisingly withdraws. The mother, on the other hand, takes up arms
and defends herself desperately to the last with large and small, though always
natural, guns. To understand this classification of natural arms, one must know
that in England when men quarrel, they carefully draw in their nails and
endeavour with clenched fist, by weight and swing alone, to fell their
adversary. But the women on such occasions leave their nails out and try not so
much to down the enemy as to bleed him with a ten-bladed scarifier. Madame
Young, however, fights here like an Amazon, combining the scarifier with the
cudgel, and yet victory is not for her; she has the clergy against her! If from
that storm one turns one's thoughts again to Rakewell's face, it almost seems
as if he heard and not a little feared its roaring. Apart from him nobody in
the whole Assembly seems to pay much attention to it, except perhaps the sole
'dearly beloved brother', the pious listener, up in the Gallery.</p>

endowed with reason, of whom we can count here precisely ten, provided, as is
only fair, the young child in arms and the old woman in front of the priest,
labelled with the I.H.S., are lumped together as one, the transition to
inanimate nature is effected most becomingly through the animals not possessing
the gift of reason. Moreover, through special circumstances, the gradation here
is almost unnoticeable. In the so-called inanimate nature Hogarth's immortal
spirit lives and works, and the animals are of a kind whose sagacity would do
honour to many a human subject in that congregation—the almost-thinking dog and
the geometrizing spider. </p>

a <a href="dogs.htm">small <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tête-à-tête</i></a>
which stands to the main group in this picture in almost the same relation as
the Assembly of Black Patricians on the pavement, described above, to that in
White's Coffee House. Hogarth's immortal pug-dog called Trump, a lively male,
is observed in secret conversation with an elderly creature of his species but
of the opposite sex, which deserves our attention for the reason that it is
carried on with three eyes only. If we examine the group a little more closely
we cannot help arriving at some rather queer ideas, for does it not look as if
the little bitch were boasting other white breast, of the little shiny bells
round her neck, and of some- thing which looks very much like a small metal
plate? And there is really something hanging down behind which would be more
suitably paraded in the open air, or at a so-called Wedding procession in the
street, than in here. All that is missing is a little bitch to occupy itself
with the culotte of the amiable lady, in which case Trump would probably also
squint that way, over the head of his beloved, whereby a certain similarity,
which we must not proclaim too loudly, would be complete. But no! Trump is
honest, and as one can see from his whole attitude, which he has not learnt
from an Essex, does not ask for anything to be thrown in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Close beside the symbolic group we have just described is
the Poors' Box, attached to one of the pews. The box must be very poor, or at
least visited more by flies than charitable fingers, for a cross-spider has
spread its net over it, as one of the safest spots for her in the whole
building, and evidently the Elders of the church have let it stay there to save
themselves the trouble of fruitlessly opening a box which cannot be rattled in
order to verify every morning that none of the contents was missing. This is
the only object in the church which would lead us to think that its wardens
were still capable of doing something, if they had a mind to. This idea of
Hogarth's has become famous, at least I had already heard about it when I was
very young. It must have really mattered to the artist that he should be
understood, in this case, and that is why he has drawn the threads of the web
so strongly that even the most cursory glance remains hanging in the web of
that satire lurking in the corner there. </p>

compensation, however, we in Germany, provided nothing untoward happens, hang

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to the Tables of the Law, just behind the Parish
Clerk, is a spot where something had once hung which must have been of
importance, not because it was behind the clerk's place, nor because a knight's
helmet with a lion still hangs above it like an emblem of the knight's virtues,
nor because a cherub's head floats above it, but because it had hung next to
the Tables of the Law. <span class=GramE>Luckily for the interpreter.</span>
Time's tooth, or more likely Wantonness' claw, or whatever it may have been,
has left just enough of it for us to see what it was. There are still upon the
precious relic the words 'I believe, etc.' It was thus the creed which used to
hang there where nothing hangs any longer. This could be interpreted as: I
believe nothing whatsoever, or everything which may be hung there again in the
future. It is a pity that the vacuum of faith there has such a very indefinite,
frayed edge. In a frame, polished, beautifully gilded, and decorated with all
the insignia of philosophy, it would provide the most eloquent symbol of
tolerance imaginable. Taking everything together, one could conceive of no
church which would combine so little outer charm with so much inner charm for
one and all, as this one. It demands nothing but faith without caring in what.
This alone would be certain to bring to her every honest person in the whole
world; furthermore, her Tables of the Law, starting from the Sixth Commandment
(our fifth), are broken, and therefore it will also enjoy the patronage of
rogues, lechers and adulterers. Also the pillar which rises between the
chamber-maid and the bride, slightly towards the pulpit, is not quite of the
order used in the First Church, and the pulpit itself completely resembles an
ancient Chair of Philosophy, which is really what every pulpit should be. A
couple of suns, with or without tonsure, one above for the pastor, and another
for the congregation, could easily be painted upon it, as here, without making
any difference in the matter. On the back of the pulpit one sees a dark circle
which is much too clear to be just accidental. It seems to be something blotted
out; a stain on a curtain which apart from its being of one piece with the rest
of the cleanliness in the church may be a symbol of how much light is coming
from there. I do not know<span class=GramE>... .</span> </p>

text-autospace:none'>Taking all in all, one can well see that the physical
aspect of this good Church of St Mary is not in a very good state, wherefore
they have tried today to deck out the old lady, in honour of the occasion, with
all kinds of foliage and green branches. Yes, it even looks to me as if that
whole pillar were nothing but a crutch which they have given her today, for the
sake of her noble customers, so that she might hold herself erect during the
wedding ceremony at least. Thus, old, decked out and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>pro nunc</i> renovated, Notre Dame, the church, reminds one somehow of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Notre Dame,</i> the bride. Yes, I almost
think that part of the decoration here appertains to both ladies
simultaneously. Our readers will notice that the boughs are not <span
class=GramE>specially</span> remarkable for their flowers, though they are
usually very generous with these in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on such occasions, and in general on all occasions. There is merely the
greenery with which the year adorns itself even while growing old, winter-green.
Out of politeness it is also called evergreen, just as black clothes are called
best clothes. Nevergreen and mourning coats would be more appropriate. What
about thy fees, though, good Amen-chimer, if the piece of wintergreen that
stands before thee knew the meaning of thy branches!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But how do we know
that this is the Church of Mary-le-Bone? It is inscribed up there on the
gallery: 'This church of St Mary-le-Bone was beautified in the year 1725. <span
class=GramE>Tho.</span> Sice <span class=GramE>et</span> Tho. <span
class=GramE>Horn Churchwardens.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here thus are the names not only of the church but also of the church-
wardens who in the year 1725 so intensely beautified it that in the year 1735
it looked as it did. Nichols makes a point of remarking that these are not
fictitious names, but they really are the names of the churchwardens of that
year. A parochial inspection could not have done more. The church was in fact
demolished and a new one erected into which this barn here could be fitted,
even more comfortably than the one at Loretto, in its casing. The old church
really was as small as this, and thus indeed very small, not more than the
width of three crinolines; also the pews seem more in proportion with the
church than with the human body. In the double-bed on the left-hand side,
people could not possibly have been awake, certainly not standing. Even Trump,
who stands here next to his little winter-green, reaches up to the key-hole.
That it was indeed a pew, however, and not perhaps a relic or a holy wardrobe,
is proved by the inscription. We give that here to save our readers the trouble
of deciphering it for themselves. It is remarkable for the 'spelink' and
diction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Thus
it is a private church pew and not a wardrobe. However, since there is a burial
vault beneath, the matter is to some extent explained. Perhaps the pew is half
below ground and level with the ancestors, and would thus as temporal sleeping
accommodation provide communication with the eternal through the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>memento mori</i> or as a reminder of the
Resurrection. Mr Gilpin has gone sadly astray as an art critic in this picture.
This often happens to critics in practice. 'The perspective,' he says,
'deserves praise, only the church appears to be too small, and the wooden
pillar which serves no special purpose divides the picture in a rather
unsuitable way.' Mr Gilpin, usually so subtle, has not taken into consideration
that the Creed and the Tables of the Law on the wall there and the face of
Rakewell's sweetheart have been still more unhappily divided. Had he enquired
from the churchwardens, he could perhaps have discovered the uses of the
pillar. It served as a prop for the church and in addition was quite
indispensable for people who have a propensity for putting the revenues of the
church into their own pocket. The whole thing is drawn from life and with a
purpose which, if Hogarth really had the intention of expressing ideas thereby,
would conform only <span class=GramE>with</span> a debasing and not an
elevation of the subject (235-245). </p>
