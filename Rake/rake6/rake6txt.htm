    of that company are beyond everything, so varied are they, ranging over almost 
    the whole scale of human emotions. Indolent vacuity on the lowest step, a 
    proper moral nihilism; wary, constitutional gravity, and gravity of a callous 
    sort through acquired insensitivity; ill-humour deeply and quietly introspective, 
    and ill-humour with expressions of incipient despair; gnashing, raging despair 
    as it raves against itself and fate, or armed with a murderous weapon turns 
    suspiciously on others; cool-bloodedness if fortune smiles and comfortable 
    joy while it lasts amid a roaring tumult of malediction from the luckless 
    ones upon whose ruin it has been built; fear, terror in all its forms, everything 
    in a degree which renders a man insensible to anything but what is here at 
    stake; all this is to be observed here in motley mixture. It is terrible! 
    If now in addition we could listen, even for a moment, in front of the door 
    there to the crashing of chairs, the chinking of guineas paid up one by one, 
    and the heavy rustling of money dragged across the table in masses; curses 
    and oaths ejaculated with all the power of language and of the human voice; 
    the barking of dogs joining in, and all that amid shouts of murder and fire! 
    What should we suppose it was? A gambling party? Surely, if it were not for 
    the chinking of money, we would take it rather to be a worldly dispute about 
    human rights? Or a spiritual one about precedence for eternal bliss? Or, to 
    hazard the mildest guess, a lively discussion in the realm of the civic dead—the 
    lunatic asylum? But it is really so—they are gambling. From that box on the 
    table they await the verdict of chance on the possession of their fortunes, 
    and Rakewell has lost everything! His treasures are gone and nothing is left 
    to him but—his little treasure! He throws himself upon his knees, he grinds 
    his teeth, and with epileptic, staring eye and threatening fist calls upon 
    Heaven that is guilt- less of all this. His right foot rises tremblingly upon 
    the toes, his right arm rises too, and so does the left opposite it, like 
    outspread wings. It is too late! Were they the wings of Aurora, punishment 
    would still hover over him. What sort of angels' voices can they be to which 
    he listens, or is it the jangling of prison keys or the rattling chains of 
    Bedlam which he hears?—There lies the torn out hair, the empty wig beside 
    the empty purse, and between the two the poor pigtail, the handle by which 
    it was flung down; a pitiful exclamation mark and at the same time a sign 
    of the cross. Miserable wretch! If only thy Captain were here. 'His sword 
    may serve thee.' His chair collapses with him, and behind it a dog from Covent 
    Garden expresses his sympathy with so profound a fall. A change of fortune 
    must be very great before poodles observe it. </span></p>

    in his pocket, over which now the toad-like shape of a strange hand squats 
    upon the table. Before, he was mourning the loss of a relative, and now, much 
    more deeply, the loss of his legacy. There is a curious contrast in the convulsive 
    expression of despair at the sudden loss of money acquired by our hero through 
    marriage, and by his neighbour through inheritance. The former, as if filled 
    with explosive air and set on fire, bursts through excess of tension; the 
    latter like a pricked bubble collapses. There is really in the attitude of 
    each something that reminds one of a wedding and a funeral. The one has at 
    least the explosive force of the man <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in 
    jubilo,</i> and the other the shrivelled attitude of the mourner, reminiscent 
    of sackcloth and ashes. Perhaps in the painting Rakewell’s garment even has 
    the wedding-like white and silver. The contrast between these two gamblers 
    has been intentionally exaggerated by our artist. For Rakewell's scheming 
    head even the wig is too tight; everything makes for expansion. With his neighbour 
    everything shrinks within, and in addition he even presses hat and wig inwards 
    with both hands; and while the former raises his right arm with great force, 
    it seems almost as if the latter had used the little raising power which was 
    left to him for raising his left leg. </span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

    dice everything which he had acquired that evening on the highway with his 
    pistol, and now his conscience also calls him to account, and the balance 
    is rather terrifying for him. His meditation here is really an execution by 
    conscience; very understandable. From the gallows side the outlook is always 
    the same; the crime has been committed, it can never be undone; from now on 
    he is for the gallows as soon as he is discovered, and even his own horse 
    may betray him. From the other side the outlook is no better. What he had 
    hoped to acquire by crime, and had in fact acquired, is lost, gone for ever; 
    he is again as poor and destitute as he was a few hours ago, and then he was 
    perhaps still innocent; now the gallows will be ever before him, ready to 
    receive him; the hateful Greek letter &#928; will from now on form the frame 
    to every plan of the intellect and every picture of the imagination. With 
    such a Calculus and a prospect like this it is small wonder if a complete 
    physical paralysis sets in. He no longer sees or hears or feels. The boy standing 
    in front of him, calling him loudly and even shaking him, simply does not 
    exist for him. With smell and taste it is probably no better, for even the 
    refreshing draught he ordered gets no attention. He has even forgotten to 
    hide the pistol and the mask. Luckily for him, the boy, the only reasonable 
    being in the whole company who is still capable of observation, is not standing 
    on that side, otherwise the above-drawn frame around the vision in that hero's 
    imagination might quickly become the frame around the hero himself. I do not 
    quite understand the meaning of the white stroke between the pistol and the 
    floor: is it a lace from his garment, or is he perhaps even a tailor? He sits 
    in front of the hearth which is protected by a wire netting. This is not a

    from throwing dice-box, cards, hats, precious purses (when they are empty 
    of course) and wigs, together with their exclamation mark, into the fire. 
    Fortune's priests are said to be rather inclined to offer their goddesses 
    such additional sacrifices of the negative kind, and she again is said to 
    be just as ready, with as gracious a face as she can muster, to accept such 
    sacrifices. Not far from the fire- place is a niche with a similar fencing 
    around it. What could that be? Perhaps a table stands there with glasses or 
    refreshments which should not be exposed to collisions with wigs. If every 
    keyhole, as they say, represents a lampoon upon the nobility of human nature, 
    what about such wire netting? We can see we are here in the ante-room of a 
    madhouse. </span></p>

    He has surely been hit in a tender place. What he holds here so pointedly 
    in front of his mouth does not seem to be the part of his person on which 
    he really gnaws; he is taking a bigger bite inwardly. Are his eyes perhaps 
    directed upon the heavy, double-backed gentleman at the table who is raking 
    in the money, and does perhaps envy mingle with incipient despair? In that 
    event he deserves double compassion. To be obliged to look on in cold blood 
    while our lost money is being raked in is in itself hard enough, but to see 
    it gathered up by the warm, puffy, broad hand of a well-fed, carefree fellow 
    like that, slowly, and with quiet secret satisfaction, is unendurable. Although 
    it is difficult to explain, there is really something extremely mortifying 
    when in a game the lean, or even the moderately plump, lose to the corpulent. 
    Whether those think themselves cleverer because they are more agile, or whether? 
    on a completely opposite principle, they reckon the temporal fact of corpulence 
    as a temporal good in itself and mere superfluity, or whether they believe 
    that he is more deserving of money who earns it with a sanguine impetuosity,

    a poor devil, possibly quite innocent, whom he takes for a cheat. Even that 
    means looking much too far. Luckily he wields his sword just as clumsily as 
    the dice, otherwise the game could have cost him very dear. And then a good- 
    hearted mediator lends him some of his own reason—one might almost say, of 
    his own wig. The latter is quite a natural consequence of the former. For 
    since in difficult cases like this it would be impossible for heads to understand 
    each other indirectly through words, the best they can do is to talk and at 
    the same time let their arguments, together with the skulls under which they 
    lie, run tilt against one another. The method is excellent and we have reason 
    to believe that many controversies in this world, especially the learned ones, 
    would not have gone so far if one had tried to settle them by this method. 
    For in the first place, all verbal quarrels would, eo ipso, be cut short at

    the appearance of exerting gentle pressure with the head rather than administering
