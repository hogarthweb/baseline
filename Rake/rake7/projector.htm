    full of holes, a paper floats to the ground, &#8220;A New Scheme for solving

    </b>The man who watches over <a
href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young's</a> decency we have called 'the man in négligé 
    and hope the reader will have nothing against the expression. The wig is, 
    like Rakewell's and like his angel's hair, governed merely by hazard; a long 
    time unpowdered, but the more frequently de- powdered, probably by mere forceful 
    hitting of, and curling round, the chair back, as if upon a flax-spindle. 
    His beard seems to keep pace with the calendar months and is fairly far advanced 
    'in its 'teens'. To judge from his physiognomy he must be a very low type, 
    but his dressing-gown persuades me to recognize him as an author. The elbow 
    has actually written its way out, and the writing sleeve suggests the meditation 
    sleeve, which must carry the head as well. Although trousers are not of special 
    importance where the dressing-gown is master of the house, yet one will rarely 
    find a pair which shuns the light so utterly as these do here. They come to 
    an end around the knee, one does not quite know how, almost with a mere etcetera. 
    It rather looks as if they had been a pair of pantaloons of which the lower 
    parts had been gradually used up in the service of the uppers. It is interesting 
    to note here that at that time people already mourned for shoe buckles, at 
    least in the London debtors' prisons. The bellows-blower position in which 
    the prisoner appears has, apart from the purpose of supporting the fainting 
    woman, another two-fold one. For in the first place, the hands being occupied, 
    the trousers have evidently lost their primary support. In order to prevent 
    their immediately taking the place of the cut-off parts, some remedy was called 
    for, and that consisted in the thigh adopting the horizontal position. In 
    the second place, the man had got hold somewhere of a few bundles of manuscript, 
    which now take themselves off as well; three of them are already lying for 
    the greater part on the ground, soon to be followed by the fourth, though 
    this one he seems to be still trying to grip. Although none of it is breakable, 
    this gives a bad impression, and in the end everything would have to be gathered 
    up again. This little disorder is of extraordinary value to an inquisitive 
    spectator. We learn here the owner of the many-cornered elbow. On one of the 
    bundles we read the words :'Being a new Scheme for paying ye Debts of ye Nation 
    by T. L., now a prisoner in the Fleet.' It is thus by an author who cannot 
    pay his own debts. The idea has become as famous as the spider's web over 
    the Poors' Box, probably because it is, like that, as clear as it is pertinent. 
    Also the frailties they denounce are equally common. To deny others the help 
    one could have given without any harm to oneself is as common in human beings 
    as it is to present them, in times of distress, with rules of conduct which 
    have brought the donor himself to bankruptcy. Such a Mr L. is said to have 
    really existed at that time. This does not surprise me; there are always people 
    like that, perhaps with other initials, and with other projects! Oh there 
    is no country and no Faculty free of them: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mutato nomine de Te,</i> and so on (259-260). </p>
