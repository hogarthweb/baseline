    money in the gambling house, Rakewell is confined in a debtors' prison (the 
    Fleet Prison). His old one-eyed wife (who seems to have lost some weight) 
    harangues him; <a href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young</a>, accompanied by <a href="daughter.htm">their 
    child</a>, has arrived and fallen into convulsions&#8212;perhaps as a result 
    of the latest bad news. In those days every gentleman wrote a play, and so 
    Rakewell has thus attempted to recoup his losses; his manuscript has just 
    been returned to him (&quot;Act 4&quot; is legible in the roll of manuscript) 
    with a letter: &quot;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sr</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>I have read your Play &amp; find it will not doe y8 J. R. .h</i>&quot; 
    (John Rich, manager of the Covent Garden Theatre). This latest blow may account 
    for Sarah's convulsions as well as Rakewell's expression. Finally, the turnkey 
    demands &quot;Garnish money&quot; (as his ledger shows), and a <a
href="turnkey.htm">boy demands money</a> for a pot of beer he has brought him 
    (168-169). </p>

  <p>We learn by a letter on the table, that a play which he sent for the manager&#8217;s

    was ignorant of spelling, for his warmest admirers to contest the point any

    </b>And here they are. Here he is now writhing under the lash of his deserved 
    misfortune&#8212;<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tout beau</i>! Would it be possible to depict 
    sorrow, misery, and awakened conscience with all the two-edged torture of 
    fear and remorse in a debauched good- for-nothing more strongly than here? 
    He is not yet articulate. In place of words, however, a wave of eloquent trembling 
    runs through his emaciated limbs, from below upwards. The hand propped upon 
    the knees is lifted with deep significance, and is followed in sympathy by 
    the foot, just as the corrugated brow draws after it the eyelids and the shoulders; 
    the stream flows upwards. But this is no picture of uplift, or at least it 
    is only the sort which is inseparable from gestures expressive of a deep fall, 
    impotence and destruction. Everything falls only the deeper, and thus he pronounces 
    his own sentence of <span class=GramE>damnation,</span> and through despair 
    becomes his own hangman. What does he see now with those staring eyes? <span class=GramE>Perhaps 
    the dancing master or the gardens or the race-horses?</span> Or does he see 
    absolutely nothing? Or does his ear listen to the melody of Orpheus who tamed 
    the beasts? Oh, if only he still had the little gold snuff-box! Here the beasts 
    are tamed more economically! We shall see how it is done. The means are drastic. 
  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to him stands the little acquisition which he made in
the <a href="../rake5/rake5txt.htm">Church of Mary-le-Bone</a>, his dear wife,
albeit somewhat changed. <span class=GramE>Her mouth, which there curved gently
into a tender smile, like Luna a few days after her rebirth, could here with
its full black circle indicate the new moon in some village almanack.</span>
Yet, what is more, her whole head which reminded us of the friendly and
peaceful crunching of a dainty squirrel has been transformed here into a lion's
head with mane, and with jaws that would crack human skulls like hazel nuts. It
is quite certain that after the wedding things are rather different from what
they were before. Here she is using her little fists, which have just hurriedly
attended to the arrangement other own hair, for effecting a slight alteration
in that other husband. To be exact, she probably only intends to help his
memory a little over certain details concerning her dowry, which could not be
achieved by that method without a disturbance of the capillary system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>To be sure, she proceeds very properly. She first applies
her left fist to his shoulder, so as to shake loose his firmly embedded
thoughts, and as soon as she sees that they are afloat, starts an attack with
the right fist just in the place where they are swimming, to set them off in
the new direction. That is how one even imparts polarity to iron. It cannot
fail. But all this, troublesome though it may be in such circumstances for a
man of feeling, is by no means so disagreeable to the poor devil as the
terrific salvo of grape-shot which his better half's tongue shoots out of that
dark thieves' kitchen into his ears and his heart. Here he indeed deserves our
pity. This is too hard on <span class=GramE>him,</span> one would be inclined
to say, if it were not so natural, and if something that is natural could also
be hard. All authors writing about the defensive system of the fair sex, and of
its military operations in the matrimonial campaign, speak of that part of its
artillery as of a sort of miracle. Fielding, one of the most illustrious,
remarks that the wisest men have trembled before it, and that even the most
valiant who were capable of looking in cold blood into the mouth of a
24-pounder had shrunk back with pitiful face if required to look into the mouth
of such a mortar. If the wisest and most valiant among men have done so, what
must he now be suffering who is neither the one nor the other, and who in
addition is not even in a position to slink away? And yet this is by no means
all. While the woman attacks him from in front and upon the right flank,
another enemy attacks his left flank, and a third his rear, while at the same
time he is notified by an acquaintance in a friendly letter that his main
arsenal has been blown up. Indeed under such circumstances no one but Socrates
or Charles XII could sit otherwise than does Rakewell here (254-255). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>And
now for the bundle of papers and the note containing the news of the blown-up
powder-magazine! This blow is one of the hardest, and acts as powerfully upon
his spirit as does the fire released by his prison mate upon his heart. It is
unbearable. The note reads thus: 'Sir, I have read your Play and find it will

as follows: this Mr Rich was then director and manager of one of the largest <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
theatres. Rakewell had submitted to him the MS. marked Act 4. It contains a
play which he had written in his leisure hours under the auspices of the tenth
Muse, who despite the decay of all the remaining nine still holds her own in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as well as in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
I mean <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Paupertas audax.</i> He had hoped
to bid farewell to life if not as a rich man, at least with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>splendida miseria</i> of a modern <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bel esprit.</i> All these hopes are now
dashed to the ground at one blow by the letter. All is over now, flown away,
gone&#8212;'it will not do'. What could the theme of that play have been? <i

class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Road to Ruin?</i> Not very likely, for it
is in the nature of a bad author not to know himself, and never to write about
things which he alone could write about (256-257). </p>
