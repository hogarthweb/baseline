style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span></span></b>Sir William Hamilton, in his
report of the last eruption of Vesuvius in the Summer of 1794, remarks that
around the foot of that dangerous mountain and the neighbouring Somma, and thus
within a circumference of about SO Italian or 8 German miles, there lived more
people than on any plot of similar area in the whole of Europe. People seemed
to crowd around the volcano's mouth like gnats around a flame; even if some of
them burned their wings, others always came to take their place; so little did
they avoid or realize the peril. This is indeed curious, and yet far less
curious than that, in a country of freedom and plenty like <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
just those houses should be most crowded where everybody who enters must first
make at the door his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>votum obedientiae
passivae et frugalitatis.</i> And that all the scheming and effort of a good
part of that happy throng should lead to just the sort of life that would one
day end in such a monastery. A plan like this rarely miscarries if one is
seriously intent upon it, and of how it can be most easily effected, we have a
clear example in the life of our hero. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>He has just been accepted, has made his vow, and is still
preoccupied with those importunities of the heart which such changes usually
produce in people of the true anointing. It is not long since he left the
world. His bed lies there, not yet unpacked. A grill is tied on to it. That is
all he has taken with him from the secular world. If only his conscience is at
peace! I am almost afraid that in <a href="rake.htm">Rakewell</a> the outer man
has not yet succeeded in coming to terms with the inner one. In that case, the
grid-iron tied to the bed may be, if not the model, at least the symbol of the bedstead,
upon which he intends to roast himself alive at night, on his own memories. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What sort of monastery it is, the reader will already have
guessed from the grated door and the Chamberlain's key which hangs from the hip
of Pater Cubicularius. Rakewell is in prison, more precisely in the Fleet, also
a sort of Lombard, distinguishable from the usual institutes of this sort only
by its being not so much a prison for movables as for the prime movers
themselves, and roughly what we call in Germany <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Schuldturm,</i> a 'debtors prison'. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Earlier, there was mention of certain blessings and
prophecies which might be fulfilled in our hero. And here they are. Here he is
now writhing under the lash of his deserved misfortune—tout beau! Would it be
possible to depict sorrow, misery, and awakened conscience with all the
two-edged torture of fear and remorse in a debauched good- for-nothing more
strongly than here? He is not yet articulate. In place of words, however, a
wave of eloquent trembling runs through his emaciated limbs, from below
upwards. The hand propped upon the knees is lifted with deep significance, and
is followed in sympathy by the foot, just as the corrugated brow draws after it
the eyelids and the shoulders; the stream flows upwards. But this is no picture
of uplift, or at least it is only the sort which is inseparable from gestures
expressive of a deep fall, impotence and destruction. Everything falls only the
deeper, and thus he pronounces his own sentence of damnation, and through
despair becomes his own hangman. What does he see now with those staring eyes?
Perhaps the dancing master or the gardens or the race-horses? Or does he see
absolutely nothing? Or does his ear listen to the melody of Orpheus who tamed
the beasts? Oh, if only he still had the little gold snuff-box! Here the beasts
are tamed more economically! We shall see how it is done. The means are
drastic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to him stands the little acquisition which he made in
the <a href="../rake5/rake5txt.htm">Church of Mary-le-Bone</a>, his <a
href="rake.htm">dear wife</a>, albeit somewhat changed. Her mouth, which there
curved gently into a tender smile, like Luna a few days after her rebirth,
could here with its full black circle indicate the new moon in some village
almanack. Yet, what is more, her whole head which reminded us of the friendly
and peaceful crunching of a dainty squirrel has been transformed here into a
lion's head with mane, and with jaws that would crack human skulls like hazel
nuts. It is quite certain that after the wedding things are rather different
from what they were before. Here she is using her little fists, which have just
hurriedly attended to the arrangement other own hair, for effecting a slight
alteration in that other husband. To be exact, she probably only intends to
help his memory a little over certain details concerning her dowry, which could
not be achieved by that method without a disturbance of the capillary system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>To be sure, she proceeds very properly. She first applies
her left fist to his shoulder, so as to shake loose his firmly embedded
thoughts, and as soon as she sees that they are afloat, starts an attack with
the right fist just in the place where they are swimming, to set them off in
the new direction. That is how one even imparts polarity to iron. It cannot
fail. But all this, troublesome though it may be in such circumstances for a
man of feeling, is by no means so disagreeable to the poor devil as the
terrific salvo of grape-shot which his better half's tongue shoots out of that
dark thieves' kitchen into his ears and his heart. Here he indeed deserves our
pity. This is too hard on him, one would be inclined to say, if it were not so
natural, and if something that is natural could also be hard. All authors
writing about the defensive system of the fair sex, and of its military
operations in the matrimonial campaign, speak of that part of its artillery as
of a sort of miracle. Fielding, one of the most illustrious, remarks that the
wisest men have trembled before it, and that even the most valiant who were
capable of looking in cold blood into the mouth of a 24-pounder had shrunk back
with pitiful face if required to look into the mouth of such a mortar. If the
wisest and most valiant among men have done so, what must he now be suffering
who is neither the one nor the other, and who in addition is not even in a
position to slink away? And yet this is by no means all. While the woman
attacks him from in front and upon the right flank, another enemy attacks his
left flank, and a third his rear, while at the same time he is notified by an
acquaintance in a friendly letter that his main arsenal has been blown up.
Indeed under such circumstances no one but Socrates or Charles XII could sit
otherwise than does Rakewell here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>A <a href="turnkey.htm">boy</a>, or whatever sort of
creature it is (for in the formation of his physiognomy insolence seems to have
been working for at least a quarter of a century), has brought him the porter
as requested, though for the time being only to look at. Without barter the
poor wretch, languishing for a drink, will not have a taste of it, and there is
nothing left to barter! Even the shoe buckles seem to be only mourning buckles,
whose lacquer or blueing has already been mourned away. Behind him stands the
executioner under-turnkey! To judge from the book which is resting on his arm,
he wants to call in the garnish money, the 'welcome' from the prisoner. The
face, which the fellow also offers for sale, seems to be one of the best which
he is capable of producing, in the interests of the transaction. It is a pity
that Rakewell does not see it, but he would not have been able to buy it in any
case. The insolvency which can no longer pay for a can of beer will probably be
content with such faces as insolence presents gratis. Does the reader notice
the conclusion, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in forma iuris,</i> which
is drawn here? A poor devil who has been put in prison be- cause he cannot pay
is required to pay for being in prison. Just like this, a few years ago, did
the French deal with the good city of <st1:City><st1:place>Worms</st1:place></st1:City>,
merely because, as they said, that city had offended the good city <st1:City><st1:place>Worms</st1:place></st1:City>

containing the news of the blown-up powder-magazine! This blow is one of the
hardest, and acts as powerfully upon his spirit as does the fire released by
his prison mate upon his heart. It is unbearable. The note reads thus: 'Sir, I
have read your Play and find it will not doe. Yrs. J. R. ... ch. The
explanation is briefly as follows: this Mr Rich was then director and manager
of one of the largest <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
theatres. Rakewell had submitted to him the MS. marked Act 4. It contains a
play which he had written in his leisure hours under the auspices of the tenth
Muse, who despite the decay of all the remaining nine still holds her own in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as well as in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
I mean <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Paupertas audax.</i> He had hoped
to bid farewell to life if not as a rich man, at least with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>splendida miseria</i> of a modern <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bel esprit.</i> All these hopes are now
dashed to the ground at one blow by the letter. All is over now, flown away,
gone—'it will not do'. What could the theme of that play have been? <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Rake's Progress,</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Road to Ruin?</i> Not very likely, for
it is in the nature of a bad author not to know himself, and never to write
about things which he alone could write about. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>What a picture this to nail up on the walls where pride of
authorship draws many a bill of exchange upon the Muses, each of which is
returned in the end like this one, with an insulting objection. Oh! all ye who
count upon a high reward from the Muses in your old age, come over here to the
torture bench of this cashiered genius; he too counted upon that reward. Such
is the fate of thousands. Consider, dearest friends., that since <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calamus</i> has other meanings in latin than
'blade' or 'reed', so <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>calamitas</i> means
more than 'damage done by hail'. Since the one includes 'goose-quill’ among its
meanings, the number of calamities for authors, and sometimes for readers too,
grows to infinity. The minor misfortune, which in the Golden and Silver ages of
the world could only be inflicted upon individuals by ruined crops, now in the
days of its senility is brought about with ten-fold intensity by writing
quills, and inflicted upon whole generations. What, after all, was a little
passing scarcity through hail compared with our present continuous indigestion
from the heavy, black, sour bread of the Muses by means of which many a citizen
of the world of learned beggars drags himself painfully along, on true <i

one of the most powerful means for improving the human race has been rendered
completely ineffective, I mean instruction by wall-posters. A group like this
one, posted up in the declination-and-conjugation stable, would be of infinite
advantage to the young. But I am afraid it is all over with that sort of thing,
just as it will soon be all over with everything. The general endeavour of the
human race to make the means the end must be regarded as a second Fall through
which in the end everything will succumb. Is there not already a class of
learned men called friends of books, and are they not merely insects with wing
cases, but without wings? Has not the timekeeping of our wise ancestors become
nowadays merely a wearing of watches? Nay, do we not hang two of them now, one
opposite the other like sentries, in a region where perhaps since the fig leaf

loosened her stays and are trying to revive her. The resuscitative method of

the cunning in her face. The swooning woman is the same Sarah Young who appears

could by itself have effected her collapse, I do not credit. The cause was
undoubtedly a moral one, but here evidently intensified rather powerfully by
physicochemical causes. For it is said that in England the air in places where
people are imprisoned, who, through no fault of their own, are suffering from
lack of gold, is not a whit better than in the secret kitchens where gold is
made, and un- fortunately this cell serves both purposes. Cold sweat over
squandered gold mingles here, as we shall hear presently, with the sulphuric
dew of mercury which usually accompanies the <st1:City><st1:place>Aurora</st1:place></st1:City>
of the newly created metal-of-metals when it rises from the crucible; however,
the moral cause is by far the stronger. Besides, it could not have been the
mere sight of her destitute lover, since Sarah Young has walked from the door
to the place where she collapsed, and it is probable that she had even been
sitting there for some time. I believe, therefore, that she fell by a salvo
from the thieves' kitchen at Rakewell's right wing. Probably she and her child
were recognized by Madame Rakewell who, suddenly loaded with 'Bastard! Whore!
and Witch!', and let fly, which of course upon a creature of Sarah Young's
character must have acted like wheelwright nails and shell splinters. As she
falls there occur a few circumstances which one hardly dares to notice, but
which, however, undoubtedly occupy a rather high place among the sufferings
which here break loose upon the sinner, Rakewell. The bared bosom of, at least,
Hogarthian beauty, the position of the foot, and in general the whole collapse
with the chair, which was perhaps more dangerous to certain eyes than it
appears now to ours, are certainly not drawn here for nothing. For Rakewell,
who sits just opposite, they must necessarily have given rise to comparisons,
which every reader has probably made already himself, between what he once so
light-heartedly cast away, and what he now calls his own upon the right wing.
Even supposing that he makes that comparison entirely upon the scales of the
senses, which with him seem to be slightly out of action, yet conscience, once
awakened, will always find on its own scales sufficient turning for despair.
There is much more here than Mr Rich's note: all might have been well, but now
it is all over; it is gone; <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it will do no
more! <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Thus far goes the thread of history in the picture. The
rest are ornaments but of such a masterly kind that we must regret there are
not more of them. Here Hogarth would have been completely in his element. The
man who watches over Sarah Young's decency we have called 'the man in négligé
and hope the reader will have nothing against the expression. The wig is, like
Rakewell's and like his angel's hair, governed merely by hazard; a long time
unpowdered, but the more frequently de- powdered, probably by mere forceful hitting
of, and curling round, the chair back, as if upon a flax-spindle. His beard
seems to keep pace with the calendar months and is fairly far advanced 'in its
'teens'. To judge from his physiognomy he must be a very low type, but his
dressing-gown persuades me to recognize him as an author. The elbow has
actually written its way out, and the writing sleeve suggests the meditation
sleeve, which must carry the head as well. Although trousers are not of special
importance where the dressing-gown is master of the house, yet one will rarely
find a pair which shuns the light so utterly as these do here. They come to an
end around the knee, one does not quite know how, almost with a mere etcetera.
It rather looks as if they had been a pair of pantaloons of which the lower
parts had been gradually used up in the service of the uppers. It is
interesting to note here that at that time people already mourned for shoe
buckles, at least in the <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
debtors' prisons. The bellows-blower position in which the prisoner appears
has, apart from the purpose of supporting the fainting woman, another two-fold
one. For in the first place, the hands being occupied, the trousers have
evidently lost their primary support. In order to prevent their immediately
taking the place of the cut-off parts, some remedy was called for, and that
consisted in the thigh adopting the horizontal position. In the second place,
the man had got hold somewhere of a few bundles of manuscript, which now take
themselves off as well; three of them are already lying for the greater part on
the ground, soon to be followed by the fourth, though this one he seems to be
still trying to grip. Although none of it is breakable, this gives a bad
impression, and in the end everything would have to be gathered up again. This
little disorder is of extraordinary value to an inquisitive spectator. We learn
here the owner of the many-cornered elbow. On one of the bundles we read the
words :'Being a new Scheme for paying ye Debts of ye Nation by T. L., now a
prisoner in the Fleet.' It is thus by an author who cannot pay his own debts.
The idea has become as famous as the spider's web over the Poors' Box, probably
because it is, like that, as clear as it is pertinent. Also the frailties they
denounce are equally common. To deny others the help one could have given
without any harm to oneself is as common in human beings as it is to present
them, in times of distress, with rules of conduct which have brought the donor
himself to bankruptcy. Such a Mr L. is said to have really existed at that
time. This does not surprise me; there are always people like that, perhaps
with other initials, and with other projects! Oh there is no country and no
Faculty free of them: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutato nomine de
Te,</i> and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Back against the wall sits another, already <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutato nomine,</i> I mean the half-charred <a
href="alchemist.htm">alchemist</a> who has a little pot upon the fire not only
for the benefit of the nation but of the whole human race. The philosophical
peace in that man's face and in his whole position really has something very
pleasing about it; one sees he has learned to wait, an art which in no
occupation in the world is more necessary than in the making of gold. That he
hears and sees nothing at all of what is going on around him he has in common with
all the people who through seeing and hearing have become immortal. The
friendship between the man and his furnace is indeed touching if one realizes
that both have finished up here only through their connection, and that each
without the other might perhaps have been something much better. Yet they cling
together as if made of one piece (they almost look like it) and feed each other
with hopes and coal until the day when the great problem will be solved. That
day cannot possibly be far off. The flue passing through the barred window is
too well designed—it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> function;
the apparatus, on the other hand, through which the rare product is to be
transferred into the bottle, is not specially good—it is bound to fail. Whether
Hogarth was himself an expert in these matters, or whether he followed here the
instructions of an expert, or whether the inspiration of genius guided his
stylus aright to an end which he himself could not have conceived, I leave
undecided. It may suffice that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>circulus
in destillando</i> cannot be mistaken; the receiver is nearer the fire than the
retort, and while each vies with the other for possession of the tincture,
everything goes up in smoke, and there we leave the solution of the problem; of
course in a sense which nobody imagined when the question was posed, but which
is an answer to that question all the same. Through the barred window something
protrudes which one might almost take for an instrument with which to ask
advice of the planets in complex chemical investigations, if the stand were not
of all-too-limited use and altogether too uncomfortable for persons accustomed
to observe with the right eye. Also the object-end of the telescope is somewhat
too near the furnace chimney. Probably it is not a tube at all, but merely a rough,
solid cylinder with which to push open or close the heavy window shutter. Up
above on the right stand some numbered vessels; they seem to be light since
they perch themselves so high up. Whether this also applies to the books of the
hanging library is not so easy to decide; the title 'Philosophica' makes it at
least doubtful. It is a wonder that with this library Hogarth has missed the
opportunity of rendering certain con- temporary works of his countrymen the
two-fold favour of treating them as prisoners in the Fleet and as the secret
confidants of the alchemist and universal doctor. If we consider the whole
design of the stove, which is really not without elegance, and if we observe
how everything fits just into that comer by the window, we can hardly avoid the
idea that the Wardens of the Fleet provide chemical stoves in the cages
reserved for gold-makers, just as one hangs rings in parrots' cages. If this is
not so, it is at least a suggestion deserving the turnkey's attention. He could
certainly count upon an annual oven-dividend. These, then, were two fanciful
types in the Fleet, and there above the bedstead lies the shed skin of a third.
For this one the arts of chemistry and of high finance were too low-grade; he
hastened to <st1:place>Olympus</st1:place> upon the eagle pinions of an Ode,
but stuck fast, as so often happened to his prototype, between the Heaven of
the bedstead and the ceiling, with head pointing downwards. The apparatus is
excellent; it must have roared and thundered bravely. It is a pity that it was so
soon over. If the feathers themselves were so firmly fixed as are the <a
href="icarus.htm">wings</a> on the body, then the man had nothing to fear from
the proximity of the sun, in contrast with his precursor Icarus, for there are
buckles and oxhide in plenty. Thus with this apparatus its inventor probably
rose from the bosom of his family and above the base monotony of his official
duties paralysing mind and body, up above the heaven of his bedstead in the
debtors' prison. If the financier T. L. had stood slightly farther back, and
nearer the alchemist, and if the left wing had been spread out slightly wider,
this group would be the most perfect <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sub
umbra alarum tuarum</i> that has ever been drawn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Lastly, I may mention that Rakewell has brought with him a
rather fine cane chair, probably the last of a dozen, and that the clock on his
right stocking is very noticeably shorter than on his left. Thus they are
either from two different pairs, or one of them has already started, from
well-known causes, to serve from above downwards, just like the trousers of the
financier from below upwards (253-262). </p>
