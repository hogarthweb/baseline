<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><a
href="drunktom.htm">Tom</a> has flung himself entirely into his work. Here we
seen the rake in action, completely and uncompromisingly debauched. In his
nineteenth-century commentary, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> relates the following poetic, yet
fitting, description of the plate: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Having
poured his libation to Bacchus, he concludes the evening orgies in a sacrifice
at the Cyprian shrine; and surrounded by the votaries of Venus, joins in the
unhallowed mysteries of the place (133). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>His
blatantly phallic unsheathed sword provides another clue to his
intentions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, this seemingly
obvious display of sexual abandon has been downplayed by Robert Cowley as
&quot;drunkenness with only an undercurrent of sexuality&quot; (58). He also
has &quot;one stocking up and one down, a traditional sign of
intoxication.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cowley does admit
that &quot;his curious, sprawling pose was a well-known metaphor of sexual
intercourse in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&quot; but his focus
remains on the alcoholic excess of the scene (58). Similarly, Derek Jarrett
claims that <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span>, &quot;drunk and pawed by the
harlots . . . looks the picture of misery&quot; (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>England</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>
</span></i><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>192) in what I
find to be a crucial misreading of Tom's clearly blissful expression in the
plate. Rather, his sexual missteps are at the forefront here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Tom's
promiscuity is troubling to <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>, and that
discomfort is evident here, as signs of disorder are featured prominently in
the scene. <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> notes the vandalism of the
portraits of Augustus, Titus and other important leaders and the preservation
of those of Nero and the like (134). This display of disrespect for authority
in the Roman Empire more than hints at an impending danger to the English
Empire as more stolidly moral leaders are shirked in favor of licentious ones. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> points out <a
href="theroofisonfire.htm">the woman in the back of the room</a> with a candle
to the world map, and, in typical dramatic style, laments that she is
“determined to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>set the world on fire,
though she parish in the conflagration!</i>” (134)<span class=GramE>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus</span>, in this scene of alcoholic and
sexual excess, the state of the -world&quot; is of little concern to the
revelers. The presence of this world map also lends a macrocosmic significance
to the events here, a significance that will be underscored in the <a
href="../rake8/rp8small.htm">final scene</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Commentators
have also noted that <span class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> current conquest is
not only fondling him but is also robbing him. His drunken lust allows him to
relinquish self- mastery. He is motivated solely by appetite: reason no longer
has its proper dominion and is given up as easily as his watch. Certainly, <span
class=SpellE>Rakewell’s</span> head is no longer making his decisions. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

passes to her accomplice, writing, &quot;It is a well-known fact that if human
beings no longer order their lives by following their clocks, then their clocks
follow them. <span class=GramE>Disorder has this advantage&quot; (219).</span>
Thus, he sees the watch's removal as a descent into confusion.<span

threatens chaos, and the plate's own caption echoes this fear: &quot;To enter

particular chemists, have held the view that man, and everything that draws
breath and wishes to do so for an appreciable time, would do best to draw it
from a mixture of one part life- giving and three parts death-giving air. This
is very remarkable. For if a human being is put into the latter alone, he will
no longer be good for anything—it would be all over with him. If, however, he
is put into the former unadulterated, oh, then life blazes up with six-fold
brilliance, his cheeks glow with youth, and his stomach digests with six-fold
power, but the rate of consumption is very rapid, and if he goes on like that
one grows apprehensive of—eternal life. How wise was it, therefore, of Heaven
to mix with the air of life eternal in our atmosphere, a threefold portion of
the air of death! Without that damper, most plants would probably, through all-too-rapid
growth, yield more straw than corn on the harvest day. I believe, therefore,
that a profound treatise on the Damper would be of immense advantage to our
modern hot-house system of education. At present there is too much
forcing-matter in it. How does Heaven rear us? If we consisted of soul only we
should all shoot up as male and female bigots, who in the end would be of no
use in either Earth or Heaven, but the well-known five dampers have the effect
that the spirit grows somewhat slower, with the result that in the end it need
not feel ashamed of being seen in either climate. <span class=GramE>But why all
this?</span> Why? I should think the application is clear enough. In the second
Plate, <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> stood in a hot-house, and now here he
sits under the influence of the damper. Today he has fought, danced—though only
with the dancing master—has taken a piano lesson, another on the French horn,
and another in the art of boxing. He has listened to a lecture and has dealt
with a good amount of domestic business. So much work requires rest wherein the
mind may gain time to brace itself again for the morning, and this he finds
here; of course, in a somewhat curious way, but that is none of our business—it
is a matter of taste. In former times there were men who sought recreation in
this way from the most difficult of all <span class=GramE>occupations, that</span>
of government, and by this means regained their capacity for ministering to
whole countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Here then the <a href="drunktom.htm">busy man</a> takes
his rest at an <st1:place>Inn</st1:place>. Whether it is a permanent brothel,
or one created by <span class=GramE>himself</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ex tempore,</i> I do not know. Nor does it matter; but the latter is
more likely. With money one can make anything out of a room in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>:
library, picture-gallery, museum, or harem, and in less than no time. <span
class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> here has chosen the last for himself and a friend.
The composition is, as we see, of almost oriental proportions, that is, apart
from the little toad with the ballad near the door, <span class=GramE>who</span>
evidently does not belong to it, ten females to two males, or more precisely
now—two men. There must have been frightful goings-on, and that for a good long
time, for the light which shines here cannot come from the four little flames
in the background. Day has dawned and mirrors itself in the bottles, and that
is very lucky for us, since without its help we should barely be able to
distinguish half of the reign of terror which has held and still holds sway
here. This Plate could serve as a warning to those who know country life only
from pastoral poetry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>There he sits now, or rather the little which still
remains of him; very little to be sure. Of the six senses which he brought with
him, hardly a single one remains, and the traces of those not yet completely
departed are no longer worthy of mention. His clothes hang loosely around him
and on him, merely following the law of gravitation, just like his limbs. The
left stocking has already reached the lowest point and with the least jerk the
right will follow its example, and then no doubt the master him- self will
follow suit. There is every indication that he has already had a slight
conflict with the law of gravitation, in which the chair behind him had its
back broken. What bliss there is in that face! The whole feeble residue of
gesture-language which still hovers about those lips seems to have assembled
merely to convey to the observer the indescribable joy of senselessness. At his
side hangs his sword across its sheath, thus already in the position in which
it is to lie over the corpse of our hero, in sign of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>,
as soon as he has accomplished his own destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We cannot possibly let him sink to rest like that without
casting a glance at his actions, and this leads us to a closer investigation of
the battlefield. Beside him on the floor lie the trophies of victory, the <a
href="drunktom.htm">lantern of the night-watchman</a>, more properly of the
watch, together with his official quarter-staff, and this is as creditable as
if the watch himself were to lie stretched out there. <span class=SpellE>Figg's</span>
pupil has done well. In the immediate vicinity and almost under the point of
the sword, apparently felled by it, lies the noblest object that could have
fallen by the sword of a hero—Julius Caesar's head. A second Caesarian (<span

in the dust amidst broken glasses, clandestine pills, and horn-lantern
fragments. <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> in his intoxication (and that is
the best time for it) has hit upon the idea of restoring the Roman Republic and
has attacked with his Jacobin the Imperial Zodiac of the first century who
adorned the wall up there. The order of the zodiacal signs there is, as one
sees, quite in conformity with the system of the place and its furniture and
movables.</p>

Aries, Cancer, Virgo, Gemini, Leo, Taurus, etc. The tyrants are really
beheaded, as far as one can see, with the exception of Nero; here was a boon
companion, a perfect devil of a fellow, who had a head on his shoulders, and so
he shall keep it there. As for the others, in place of the tiresome heads of
office which they possessed, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> seems to have
endowed them with some giddier ones for private use. It looks as if the empty
spaces were heads, or the other way round. That might often have chanced in <st1:City><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:City>
too. Augustus puts out quite a considerable piece of tongue, perhaps at the
poor Republic; <span class=SpellE>Vitellius</span> (<span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
writes <span class=SpellE>Vitelius</span>) by virtue of wig and ruff looks, on
our copy at least, really respectable, and the honest <span class=SpellE>Vespasian</span>
carries a pig's head. Did <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> take him perhaps
for the destroyer of <st1:City><st1:place>Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>?<span

The anonymous interpreter does not quite know what to make of the paunch, but
thinks he may have been an infamous brothel-keeper of the time. So maybe it is
even the landlord of that <st1:place>Inn</st1:place> whom <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span>

and in the general tumult to the left- hand comer, which, as one sees, was
already engaged. That sort of thing never does any good. Here, too, it has
given rise to confusion. The first occupant, a pot which in general is treated
with scant ceremony, and which itself very often does not stand on any at all,
inexorably pours its whole abundance over roast chickens with the fork still in
the breast, over torn off chicken legs, and plates and lemons and liqueur
glasses, and remains master of the field. The master's Spanish cane lies broken
with its strap beside it, and holds sway no longer. In the foreground lie
female garments from the deepest layers (they have made themselves thoroughly
comfortable here); they reach as far as the Emperors' heads, and past these to
mingle with the vulgar pills; and so on. All the <span class=SpellE>chairbacks</span>
within sight are broken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>This is a brief survey of the devastation of inanimate
Nature. Now for a few glances at the plight of the living. Indolence and
relaxation have here, as <span class=GramE>usual,</span> something of the
outward appearance of sobriety, and in the general arrangement of the bodies
there is at least some picturesque system. A line drawn through the heads
hovering round the table ascends gradually from right to left, and from the
turning point of a shorn head descends again towards the left with equal
inclination towards the horizon. Thus one returns more or less to the starting
point. But this is the only sort of plan to be found here, and even this is
merely consequent upon the shape of the table. Tables may well have such an
effect; they arrange in an orderly way what would otherwise have defied
arrangement, they enhance physical distance, and through their stiff neutrality
offer protection to those who sit around them, whereas a few inches less wood
might have led to murder and manslaughter. It is the same everywhere. One could
demonstrate it with a geographical map. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The black-feathered hat of our hero is rather intimately
approached by a white-feathered one. Of course, they are only hats. But the
girl certainly had this rapprochement to thank for her victory over so many
other sisters. Probably all goes into one kitty, but she was the one to achieve
it. <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> loves feathered hats, and if one of
these girls put one on, with a white feather versus his black feather, this
surely means for anybody who can read: ‘I and Thou', and that is more than half
the battle. With her right hand she feels for his heart, and thus for his pulse
at its source. But the attack is a feint. The real attack was directed at
another pulse, his watch, and that is safely delivered to the rear under the girl's
watchful eye. <span class=GramE>The hands of the watch point to </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="15"><span class=GramE>three o'clock</span></st1:time><span
class=GramE>.</span> This, even in the height of summer, would be somewhat too
early for so much light as blazes here, and which can have no other source but
the day. But there is really no difficulty here. It is a well-known fact that
if human beings no longer order their lives by following their clocks, then
their clocks follow them. Disorder has this advantage, that one can explain
everything by it. The composure with which the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>arrière-garde</i></span> receives the spoils
is <span class=SpellE>marvellously</span> expressed. Behind that face one would
hardly suspect so much acquaintance with crime. With her elbow leaning on the
chair-back of the vanquished <a href="drunktom.htm">she catches the watch</a>
with her right hand as if it were a soap-bubble, and before handing it over to
the treasure-chest it amuses her to toy with it a little, and quite near <span
class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> ears at that. She must certainly have a good
idea of how such ears in such heads work. That <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
must have been rather proud of that face can be seen from his use of contrast
by which he has thrown it into relief. Here again <span class=GramE>are</span>
English milk-and-blood on a background of African pine-soot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How the little black Satan behind there is
lit up! Hers are the liveliest eyes in the whole Plate. They are really
directed towards the <a href="plate.htm">shiny dish near the door</a> where a
girl in the attitude of the trumpeter in the second Plate blares out a very
indecent ballad, &quot;The Black Joke”. The witch seems to find amusement in
this song. Of course she too is black, and apart from that is fond of a joke,
in any <span class=SpellE>colour</span>. She puts her finger to her mouth;
probably she had intended to hide behind her whole hand as an expression of
female modesty, but decided half-way that it would be unnecessary in this
company. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In her immediate vicinity are <a href="ginspitting.htm">two
little female dragon-heads</a>, one of whom is spitting fire, and the other
foul wine. Up till now they had evidently been <span class=SpellE>duelling</span>
with tongues only, or had had their pistols loaded merely with invectives; but
now since all the linguistic ammunition has been used up, they have adopted
more substantial weapons, the one a knife and the other a fire-extinguisher.
Maybe the burning damsel had merely begged the extinguisher, the Nymph of the
well, for a drink, of which she was in need; <span class=GramE>this the</span>
other is sending her in the form of a jet, while securing the well with both
hands. A few inches less table-wood might have produced interesting results.
Between that warlike pair, just where the pyramid of the group reaches its
peak, is a rather peaceful couple. In the striking face of the girl even the
fumes of wine can hardly obscure the faint glimmer of another fire. She seems
to have the intention of ensnaring an indolent lap-dog fellow on her own
account, and evidently with poor success. The scene lies outside the limit of
our Plate. The two remaining figures at the table are very easy to understand.
They represent the technical side of the art of drinking, upon the first rung
of its ladder and upon the last. <span class=GramE>The one, quick and lively,
still drinks with the left hand alone, holding the right, which is hanging down
but not relaxed, with considerable dignity.</span> She holds her glass with
that well- known air of refinement in which the little finger is outstretched,
as if one were taking a pinch of something. The other drinks in a state of
exhaustion, grasping the overflowing vessel with both fists, and is at the end
of her tether. The first reminds one of the Greek <span class=GramE>poet</span>
who imbibes soul-giving <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chier</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>and enthusiasm in strong draughts, but
always with grace. The second, on the other hand, resembles one of our poets
who puts the heavy bucket of his publisher's demands with hopeful flourish to
his lips but, happily for his readers, empties half the heavy stout into his

text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In the background
we see a girl engaged upon a significant procedure. In her hand <a
href="theroofisonfire.htm">she holds a light</a>, and is evidently about to set
fire to something, and that something is nothing less than the one-time
property of the bright heads up there on the wall, the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Orbis</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>terrarum</span></i> itself: TOTUS MUNDUS. That <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has chosen a whore for that business is evidence of
his great familiarity with ancient history and the earliest relics of lofty
poetry. Perhaps there is more to it still. One of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
commentators made short work of it. He believes the girl had felt herself
slighted by the company and in her rage she sets the world alight, despite the
fact that she would thereby share the fate of all the others. What a joke to be
sure, and what a gift for divining and sharing <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
mood! Why not rather set fire straightaway to <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pontac's</span> house by applying the light to the staircase? No!
If that action is to have a meaning, as I believe it has, beyond the utterly
senseless craving of the drunkard for destruction, in order to relieve his
feelings, it must surely be a deeper one. Perhaps the following interpretation,
if not the true one, is at least more commensurate with <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
genius. Whoever intends to set fire to a map (of the countries themselves there
is no question here), quite <span class=SpellE>unallegorically</span>, will
begin <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>dubio</span>,</i>
if the map is hanging on the wall, with the lower edge. This, however, is not
what the poor girl is doing; indeed, she seems rather to be searching for some
particular spot, employing some bodily exertion and probably standing on
tiptoe. Now if I am not mistaken that spot is just in front of the East coast
of America, whence, as is well known, the Spaniards brought a certain product
to Europe with which girls of that type carry on a sort of smugglers' trade, up
to this day. Therefore, what one might here take for inflammation, may it not
be a mere illumination or search for the main storehouse, prompted by
mercantile-geographical curiosity? Certainly not! There is no doubt that
because she has become bankrupt in the trade she is setting fire to the world <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>effigie</span></i>
just on that spot where the former American Company first started a
conflagration <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>natura</span></i>
and lit a fire which they now try to extinguish by Amalgamation. <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> accompanies this world-conflagration with a
mischievous touch, partly concealed and thus deniable if need be, which is all
the more dangerous for an interpreter. Behind the door there stands a blind
harpist upon whose harp, funnily enough. King David, whom <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
<span class=GramE>enjoys</span> bringing into bad company, is displayed also
with a harp. Here he sits immediately in front of Nero, and one cannot avoid
the suspicion, knowing something of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
roguery, that he has been placed just there to make music for the conflagration
of the world, as did Nero for the burning of <st1:City><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:City>.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The damsel who in the foreground there seems to be making
her toilet is a rather notorious figure of that time, known as the <a
href="posture%20woman.htm">posture-woman</a>. Her name, so <span class=SpellE>Trusler</span>
declares, was <span class=SpellE>Aratine</span> (or <span class=SpellE>Aretine</span>).
She really is stripping. She is prepared to show her art, and for that purpose
to let herself be served up at table in the guise of a chicken, with a fork in
the breast, as a living dish. The dish which is being brought in over there at
the door, and which the baboon who carries it illuminates so as to advertise
the spectacle, is to be the revolving stage upon which she will per- form. This
is really abominable. But would the human race be greatly benefited were it
deprived of the faculty to descend sometimes like that below the beasts? That
here and there, in the shadiest corners of great towns, vermin is generated
which finds its amusement in such bestialities is much less to the disgrace of
human nature than the verdict of the inner judge, who <span class=SpellE>uncorruptly</span>
dwells in the breast of millions and condemns that vermin to eternal infamy, is
to its <span class=SpellE>honour</span>. A certain Englishman, <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Pawson</span>, has edited <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Joe Miller's Jests</i> with Greek notes,
which is not a jot better than a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Till <span
class=SpellE>Eulenspiegel</span></i> with Hebrew ones. I always remind myself
of that book when I am tempted to become too serious in these Commentaries.
However, since I have already mentioned one Greek note, I cannot refrain from
adding a second as balm for the trauma which <span class=SpellE>Aretine's</span>
story may perhaps have inflicted upon some tender organ. Hers is a shameful
story, it is true, but it is not only the desire of the assembled company to
revolve the plucked chicken on its dish, it is the desire of the chicken itself
to let itself <span class=GramE>be</span> revolved. It glories in it, it lives
by it, and through it can buy itself new feathers. But how if in little social
circles in many a devoutly Christian provincial town, in rooms where perhaps
in- stead of <span class=SpellE>Pontac</span> an 'Ecce Homo' looks down from
the walls, the absent <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>, nay even the absent
friend herself, is deprived of every cover for her human weakness and is served
up upon the coffee tray for the entertainment of the company, and is there
displayed to the accompaniment of giggles from the ladies and pious humbugs,
what about that?— Oh, at least take away the 'Ecce Homo' and hang up old <span
class=SpellE>Pontac</span>! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Round the dish are the words: 'John <span class=SpellE>Bonvine</span>
(<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bon <span class=SpellE>Vin</span></i>)
at the Rose Tavern, <span class=SpellE>Drurylane</span>', whereby Street and <st1:place>Inn</st1:place>
are identified wherein such orgies were celebrated in those days. The name <span
class=SpellE>Bonvin</span> justifies our assumption about <span class=SpellE>Pontac</span>.
The baboon is also a portrait of a notorious waiter at the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Rose</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Inn</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, who was known by the name of
Leather-coat. He must have distinguished himself considerably since already in
1732 Fielding had shown him on the stage in his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Covent Garden Tragedy</i> under the name of <span class=SpellE>Leathersides</span>.
He is said to have had an incredible familiarity with this type of trade;
whoever wished to acquire American products would be certain to obtain the best
addresses through him. <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> is sure to have
consulted him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>I do not quite understand what the servant on the stairs
is bringing in on his dish, or why he is there at all, but he is certainly not
put there for nothing. Does it mean that on the other floors there are similar
goings-on at this early hour, or does it indicate that this room is perhaps in
the basement and more properly is a so-called cellar? For as a rule food is
carried from English kitchens upwards and not downwards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Nichols rightly reminds us that these are no longer the
morals of the present time. Perhaps the priests and the idols are still the
same, and it is merely the liturgy which has changed, or perhaps we agree with
Dr Johnson's very clever remark: ‘It is a good thing,' he says, ‘for our young
people, if they want to be dissolute, to be so at least outside their own
country; then when they return they may start a new life with a new character.'
<span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> does not seem to envisage anything like this;
he only thought to himself: 'stay in the country and earn an honest living', or
he is quite willing to settle down abroad. Where? That we shall discover. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Herr <span class=SpellE>Riepenhausen</span> has drawn this
Plate in reverse, and in this I think he was right. Since <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
engravings are mainly copies of larger pictures, he himself did not take the
trouble, unless there was a special reason for it, to reverse them; and
therefore many well-known places and streets in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
often appear in quite the wrong direction. In our picture the light enters from
the left as it should do, <span class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> sword hangs on
the proper side, although of course the sword-belt hangs here as if it had
turned round. The spitfire grips the knife with her right hand, and the coat
buttons of the man at the head of the group are also on the right. But had
there been any carelessness here, the greatest loss, for the interpreter at
least, would have been the East coast of <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
For on the original engraving the girl lights up the <st1:place>Eastern <span
 class=SpellE>Paniglobium</span></st1:place>, and thus the <st1:place>Old World</st1:place>.
But this is also true. Only the inspection of the original painting can here
decide (215-224).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>
