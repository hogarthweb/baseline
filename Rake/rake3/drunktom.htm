Progress, Plate 3, Detail.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Tom has
flung himself entirely into his work. Here we seen the rake in action,
completely and uncompromisingly debauched. In his nineteenth-century
commentary, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:
  "MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Ireland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> relates the following poetic,
yet fitting, description of the plate: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Having
poured his libation to Bacchus, he concludes the evening orgies in a sacrifice
at the Cyprian shrine; and surrounded by the votaries of Venus, joins in the
unhallowed mysteries of the place (133). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>His
blatantly phallic unsheathed sword provides another clue to his
intentions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, this seemingly
obvious display of sexual abandon has been downplayed by Robert Cowley as
&quot;drunkenness with only an undercurrent of sexuality&quot; (58).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also has &quot;one stocking up and one
down, a traditional sign of intoxication&quot; (58).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cowley does admit that &quot;his curious,
sprawling pose was a well-known metaphor of sexual intercourse in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries&quot; but his focus remains on the alcoholic excess
of the scene. Similarly, Derek Jarrett claims that Rakewell, &quot;drunk and
pawed by the harlots . . . looks the picture of misery&quot; in what I find to
be a crucial misreading of Tom's clearly blissful expression in the plate (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England </i>192). Rather, his sexual
missteps are at the forefront here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Commentators
have also noted that Rakewell's current conquest is not only fondling him but
is also robbing him. His drunken lust allows him to relinquish self- mastery.
He is motivated solely by appetite: reason no longer has its proper dominion
and is given up as easily as his watch. Certainly, Rakewell&#8217;s head is no
longer making his decisions. Rochester jokes about and warns of the possible
political dangers of such conduct in &quot;On King Charles&quot;: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>His
sceptre and his prick are of such a length; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>And
that she plays with one, may sway the other <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>And
make him little wiser than his brother, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Poor
prince, thy prick, like thy buffoons at court, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>It
governs thee, because it makes thee sport (11-13; 16-17). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Like Rochester's Charles,
Hogarth's Rakewell is &quot;swayed&quot; by his desire. The perils of his
actions are severe: power is usurped by women, wealth becomes tenuous; the
world threatens to bum like Nero's Rome. Lichtenberg focuses on the watch that
the prostitute lifts from Rakewell and passes to her accomplice, writing,
&quot;It is a well-known fact that if human beings no longer order their lives
by following their clocks, then their clocks follow them. Disorder has this
advantage&quot; (219).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, he sees the
watch's removal as a descent into confusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Unbridled sexuality, as displayed here, threatens chaos, and the plate's
own caption echoes this fear: &quot;To enter in with covert Treason,/ O'erthrow
the drowsy Guard of Reason,/ To ransack the abandon'd Place,/ And revel there
with wild Excess?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    and a single acquaintance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The affair 
    takes place in a shabby room that may once have had pretensions to grandeur; 
    the inscription on the large plate held by the servant with the infantile 
    grin on his face reads &#8220;John Bonvine at the Rose Tavern Drury Lane.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Surrounded again by commercial people and besotted by alcohol 
    but still drinking, the rake reclines close to a bed, his clothes unbuttoned, 
    on the bosom of a solicitous harlot.<span style='mso-tab-count:

    has been drawn in a cowardly attack upon an unarmed watchman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The watchman&#8217;s battered lantern and staff 
    lie at the rake&#8217;s feet along with a broken glass, some scattered pills 
    and part of a portrait of an emperor (&#8220;Iulius&#8221;).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The innocent looking (and very sober) harlot 
    fondles Tom as she passes his watch to an accomplice (30).</p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hogarth&#8217;s Graphic Works: </i></font></b>The Rake's watch, being 
    stolen by a whore, shows 3 o'clock. At the Rake's feet are a watchman's battered 
    lantern and a watchman's staff bearing the arms of the City of London. He 
    has been in a street brawl; his sword is thrust through the pendant part of 
    his belt, implying that he has recently drawn it (probably against the watchman) 
    and in his drunken state missed the scabbard when he returned it (164).</p>
  <p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800080">Uglow: </font></b>Tom&#8217;s 
    bills, however, are catching up with him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>In the scene in the Rose Tavern, he seems as impotent as the great 
    castrato himself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He may have beaten 
    some poor old watchman, whose lantern lies at his feet, but his sword hangs 
    limply out of his scabbard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even in 
    this state he clings to marks of gentility, holding his glass just as the 
    manuals of politeness decreed (the genteel held it by the stem, the uncouth 
    by the bowl) (249).</p>
  <p>in Tom&#8217;s incapacitated, sprawling pose, with his legs at that curious 
    angle, Hogarth took over a pose used by Watteau in his painting of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Antoine de la Roque, </i>an old soldier &#8220;disabled&#8221; 
    by a wound at Malplaquet, resting on a bank with a satyr and a group of curious 
    wood nymphs peering from the background.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The print of this was engraved only in 1734, 
    while Hogarth was already working on his paintings (249-250).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Tom&#8217;s watch has been pinched by the girl behind (who 
    looks suspiciously like <a href="../../harlot/20/moll.htm">Moll</a>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Time is being snatched from him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The women&#8217;s patches spell disease, and 
    the box of pills on the floor hints that Tom is already infected (252-253).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#400080">Ireland:</font> 
    </b>This plate exhibits our licentious prodigal engaged in one of his midnight 
    festivities: forgetful of the past, and negligent of the future, he riots 
    in the present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Having poured his libation 
    to Bacchus, he concluded the evening orgies in a sacrifice at eh Cyprian shrine; 
    and, surrounded by the votaries of Venus, joins in the unhallowed mysteries 
    of the place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The companions of his 
    revelry are marked with that easy, unblushing effrontery which belongs to 
    the servants of all work in the isle of Paphos;--for the maids of honour, 
    they are not sufficiently elevated.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He may be 
    supposed, in the phrase of the day, to have beat the rounds, overset a constable, 
    and conquered a watchman, whose staff and lanthorn he has brought into the 
    room as trophies of his prowess.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 
    this situation he is robbed of his watch by the girl whose hand is in his 
    bosom; and, with that adroitness peculiar to an old practitioner, she conveys 
    her acquisition to an accomplice, who stands behind the chair (133).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#314F44">Quennell:

    and defeated a watchman whose broken lantern and staff lie tumbled at his 
    feet, he and a friend are entertaining a party of prostitutes in a shabby 
    upper room (129).</p>

    the morning, surrounded by the trophies of a street row, largely supplemented 
    by further contributions from the apartment itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> 
    </b>Here then the busy man takes his rest at an Inn. Whether it is a permanent 
    brothel, or one created by himself <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ex 
    tempore,</i> I do not know. Nor does it matter; but the latter is more likely. 
    With money one can make anything out of a room in London: library, picture-gallery, 
    museum, or harem, and in less than no time. Rakewell here has chosen the last 
    for himself and a friend. The composition is, as we see, of almost oriental 
    proportions, that is, apart from the little toad with the ballad near the 
    door, who evidently does not belong to it, ten females to two males, or more 
    precisely now&#8212;two men. There must have been frightful goings-on, and 
    that for a good long time, for the light which shines here cannot come from 
    the four little flames in the background. Day has dawned and mirrors itself 
    in the bottles, and that is very lucky for us, since without its help we should 
    barely be able to distinguish half of the reign of terror which has held and 
    still holds sway here. This Plate could serve as a warning to those who know 
    country life only from pastoral poetry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>There
he sits now, or rather the little which still remains of him; very little to be
sure. Of the six senses which he brought with him, hardly a single one remains,
and the traces of those not yet completely departed are no longer worthy of
mention. His clothes hang loosely around him and on him, merely following the
law of gravitation, just like his limbs. The left stocking has already reached
the lowest point and with the least jerk the right will follow its example, and
then no doubt the master him- self will follow suit. There is every indication
that he has already had a slight conflict with the law of gravitation, in which
the chair behind him had its back broken. What bliss there is in that face! The
whole feeble residue of gesture-language which still hovers about those lips
seems to have assembled merely to convey to the observer the indescribable joy
of senselessness. At his side hangs his sword across its sheath, thus already
in the position in which it is to lie over the corpse of our hero, in sign of
honour, as soon as he has accomplished his own destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>We
cannot possibly let him sink to rest like that without casting a glance at his
actions, and this leads us to a closer investigation of the battlefield. Beside
him on the floor lie the trophies of victory, the lantern of the
night-watchman, more properly of the watch, together with his official
quarter-staff, and this is as creditable as if the watch himself were to lie
stretched out there. Figg's pupil has done well. In the immediate vicinity and
almost under the point of the sword, apparently felled by it, lies the noblest
object that could have fallen by the sword of a hero&#8212;Julius Caesar's
head. A second Caesarian (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sectio Caesarea</i>)
has here stretched the master of the world in the dust amidst broken glasses,
clandestine pills, and horn-lantern fragments. Rakewell in his intoxication
(and that is the best time for it) has hit upon the idea of restoring the Roman
Republic and has attacked with his Jacobin the Imperial Zodiac of the first
century who adorned the wall up there. The order of the zodiacal signs there
is, as one sees, quite in conformity with the system of the place and its
furniture and movables.</p>

<p>The black-feathered hat of our hero is rather intimately approached by a
white-feathered one. Of course, they are only hats. But the girl certainly had
this rapprochement to thank for her victory over so many other sisters.
Probably all goes into one kitty, but she was the one to achieve it. Rakewell
loves feathered hats, and if one of these girls put one on, with a white
feather versus his black feather, this surely means for anybody who can read:
&#8216;I and Thou', and that is more than half the battle. With her right hand
she feels for his heart, and thus for his pulse at its source. But the attack
is a feint. The real attack was directed at another pulse, his watch, and that
is safely delivered to the rear under the girl's watchful eye. The hands of the
watch point to three o'clock. This, even in the height of summer, would be
somewhat too early for so much light as blazes here, and which can have no
other source but the day. But there is really no difficulty here. It is a
well-known fact that if human beings no longer order their lives by following
their clocks, then their clocks follow them. Disorder has this advantage, that
one can explain everything by it. The composure with which the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>arrière-garde</i> receives the spoils is
marvellously expressed. Behind that face one would hardly suspect so much
acquaintance with crime. With her elbow leaning on the chair-back of the
vanquished she catches the watch with her right hand as if it were a
soap-bubble, and before handing it over to the treasure-chest it amuses her to
toy with it a little, and quite near Rakewell's ears at that. She must
certainly have a good idea of how such ears in such heads work (216-219).</p>
