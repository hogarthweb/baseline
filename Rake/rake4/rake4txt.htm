through life. In the course of the sun this stage is called Cancer, and it
means something like that here for our hero moves steadily on the downward
path, and in fact Leo has an eye on him already. The scene is at the corner of

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>Hie</span> <span
class=SpellE>est</span></i> with profound dignity, although at the moment there
does not appear to be anybody to offer it to him. What wonders may be worked by
a badge and a warm imagination! He offers his breast to the early March air, of
which only his fingers seem to be afraid, though they cannot really be so, for
his muff looks more like a cold air bellows than a warmth accumulator. In this
way <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> indicates the birthday of his Queen. This
preliminary explanation of the scene was necessary in order to understand why <a
href="rake.htm"><span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span></a> arrives here with so
much <span class=SpellE>splendour</span>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The hatter's box as well as the <span class=GramE>wig-maker's</span>
in the <a href="../rake2/rp2small.htm">second Plate</a> have opened, and the
tailor's work has unfolded in order to adorn the artistic product of <span
class=SpellE>Figg</span>, Essex, Dubois, <span class=SpellE>Pontac</span> and
Co for the festive day. The fellow wants to go to Court; to mix with the swarm
of bees—the wasp! He does not appear to have a carriage of his own (remember
the sign of the Lion), he chose therefore for the transport of his noble self
the cheaper four-legged domestic animal, the <span class=SpellE>porte</span>-chaise.
Concealed in it, he believed he would come warm and safe to St James's, there
to gaze upon the light of the great world in quite a natural way, like hundreds
of others, merely by getting out of his vehicle. But he has miscalculated.
Certain events intervene. It is a difficult birth; the dandy is fetched out
with forceps on the public highway. One has incurred debts which one is unable
to pay and one is arrested. That this event involves not an active but an
exceedingly passive descent from the vehicle can be seen from the fact that the
fore- most bearer is still holding the two poles, and is only unable to proceed
be- cause his hindmost colleague with leek in hat is already occupied in
raising the roof of the post-chaise so that <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span>—should
not ruin his coiffure. Excellent! A <a href="arrest.htm">police officer</a> is
presenting to him a strip of paper, hardly a few inches long, but also,
simultaneously, a cudgel which is somewhat longer, and that strip of paper acts
on our hero as if it were the heavenly beam itself which flashes so brilliantly
over there to the accompaniment of thunder. Indeed it is no mean weapon which
strikes here, but one of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>foudres</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> de <span
class=SpellE>poche</span></i> of English Justice which unfailingly find their
man, a warrant of arrest; awe-inspiring at any time, but here, introduced by
Heaven with a peal of thunder, even terrible! Hamlet, if the ghost had appeared
to him when he was leaving a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>porte</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>-chaise,</i>
could hardly have been more petrified than <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span>
here. It looks as if the lightning of Heaven had struck him in the literal
sense of the word. Electricity-wise persons will find everything they seek
here. The hair-bag rises off his shoulders as if standing on end, the fingers <span
class=GramE>are</span> spread like spikes, the eye stares without seeing. He is
really struck and knocked out, for the vermin notice it and fall upon him. The
mischievous lamplighter intentionally overfills the lamp, and the surplus
streams on to <span class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> festive clothes. That he
does this purposely can be surmised from his lower lip, and his eye looking
where there is less to see than is below him. However, he does damage like an
honest man, without deriving any advantage from it. Not quite <span
class=GramE>so</span> honest as this satirist upon the ladder is a member of
the small club which here upon the pavement of a public street is holding its
sessions, without any proper seats. He is stealing a hand- kerchief from the
poor all-but-prisoner's pocket. This is how that action is usually interpreted.
I too have nothing against it, but I should humbly like to advise people to be
rather careful in the use of the word 'steal', and in too hastily declaring as
theft every means of acquisition without compensation, thereby reducing the
number of honest people in the world by half. The incredible legerdemain of the
English so-called pick-pocket really does not deserve the name of stealing. In
fact the boy here does no more than any thorn-bush in a hedge along the way; he
robs not by pulling but by being pulled, and to plunder by mere reaction is <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>eo</i></span></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> ipso</i> no longer plunder. After all, it
is the officer of the law who is depriving the handkerchief of its master.
Londoners are familiar with this sort of thing. If the tiniest bit of a
handkerchief is hanging out of some- body's pocket, the very first man who
meets him will say: 'Sir, you'll lose your handkerchief,' and not 'Your
handkerchief will be stolen.' For shame! <span class=GramE>who</span> would say
such a thing? Indeed, handkerchiefs are not stolen out of pockets there; they
are only lost to responsive fingers on the road. It is the constellation of
events that matters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Misfortunes seldom
come singly; even the comfort which he unexpectedly encounters here, and which
otherwise would have warmed him like a ray of sunshine, has the form of
lightning and humiliation for him. It is impossible to fall any deeper. <span
class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> falls in the eyes of the world, and even—in his
own. That is the very depths. <a href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young</a>, the girl who
on the first Plate he so light-heartedly turned away, has in the meantime
earned a living as a milliner. She passes this way, sees the danger which
threatens her faithless seducer, and hastens with her little all to buy the
freedom of the scoundrel who had regarded the thousandth part of his income as
too dear a price for her <span class=SpellE>honour</span> and faithfulness. She
tenders her purse to the officer of the law in such haste that she forgets
everything else, and her little bundle of goods falls from under her arm. That
sort of thing may help. Even if the dandy cannot attend at St James's, which
after the anointing he has suffered he could not very well do, he may at least
be able to chew his nails again in his own chair of sorrow till better times!
That the girl should be passing here just at this moment seems to me to happen
quite naturally. She still loves <span class=GramE>him,</span> she has followed
his movements from afar, and wanted perhaps today to see him once in all his
glory. One cannot but heartily forgive this faithful creature who, as we shall
see, is to visit him still where gala clothes are never displayed. Besides,
days like this, and in this part of the town, are for milliners like blossom
time for the bees. They swarm from one Court flower to the other, which on such
occasions arrive by the hundred to deck the rich flowerbeds of St James's with
their <span class=SpellE>colours</span>. The eye wanders from one to the other,
gathering material for the imagination which thus laden with the finest stuff
of ideas returns to the working cell. Thus the reasons why little Sarah should
be here are poetically valid and good, and so surely will be the moral feelings
which our good-hearted gatherer will this time bring back instead of ideas, no
matter how despicable was the little nettle which provided the substance for
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> surrenders apparently
without resistance; perhaps what induced him to it, apart from the sight of the
well filled purse, is the all-too- clearly displayed second cudgel which a <a
href="assistant.htm">sort of <span class=SpellE>Figg</span></a> with an already
patched up face holds there in his hand. The <span class=GramE>cudgel as well
as the fellow who carries it, and who, even while discharging official duties,
is chewing tobacco, seem</span> both to be as coarse and cold as nature made
them, each possessing about an equal amount of feeling. It would be just as
impossible to fight against the cudgel with kid gloves as against its owner
with academic eloquence. In that position the most reasonable thing one can do
is to compose carefully all wayward extremities and to make oneself in words
and actions as pliant and compact as possible so that nothing should tear or
break while one is arrested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>This is the part of the Plate which continues the story
proper. We now come to the side strokes. One would hardly suspect them here,
yet a Plate by <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> in which these were missing
would really be like a picture by <span class=SpellE>Wouvermann</span> without a
horse, and therefore of just as little value. Not only are they not missing
here, but <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has dealt them with unusual force
and bitter roguery, and has wielded the lash so that it is felt through
ceremonial wigs, decoration--ribbons and stars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In the background to the right there hangs from one of the
houses a little white signboard inscribed with the name 'White'. This is
White's notorious Coffee House, of which every one of our readers must have
heard, slight though his acquaintance with English authors may be. This is the
very establishment in whose <span class=SpellE>honour</span> the white
lightning up there in the sky has been hung out. May the lightning strike you! <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> seems to say, and indeed the inmates really deserve
something like lightning It is in fact the house where the value of a whole
Estate is often staked upon a card or upon dice, and if that goes, houses
follow suit, and after them the gold shirt buttons—we had a famous example of
this a few years ago—and then—FINIS; it is the place where wealth and beggary
change places in a second; the source of thousand-fold misfortunes and misery,
of duels, of despair, of incurable madness, of raving mania and suicide. It is
for this den that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> intended the lightning with
its basilisk-tail. But why did he not bring it right into the house through the
window, or more scientifically by the high chimney or the lightning-attractor,
the protruding rod?! As it is, it hangs in the air just as un- naturally as
Sarah Young's millinery box. Surely, it can be in no doubt as to where it ought
to go here! That would only be excusable if the slinger of its fire were a
mortal. Many a <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> house might
be under the same sentence for similar crimes, so that in its execution the
choice may sometimes be rather difficult. Besides, the <span class=SpellE>zig-zag</span>
is really the line of indecision, and I cannot therefore entirely blame a
certain good lady for thinking that the reason why lightning went <span
class=SpellE>zig-zag</span>, and changed its course so often, was that it again
and again turned away from regions where people had repented in a hurry.</p>

if while the lightning shoots towards the Coffee House, the sun is shining upon
St James's Palace. Such a distribution of storm and sunshine between buildings in
the same street is not only possible but even quite common. If <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> really had some intention with this, it may have
been to offer his congratulations on that day of national rejoicing to his
Queen in perhaps a subtler form than did any of those big-wigs down in the
street who are about to be disgorged from their vehicles. But if this was not
his intention, or he had something else in mind with his distribution of light,
the interpreter of these Plates craves his readers' forgiveness if an assumption
which then, of course, could not be valued as a special proof of his acuity, is
left standing as an expression of his opinion, at least, of St James's and
White's Coffee House. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

let us see how <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> strikes at the very same
house, or rather at its inmates— it is a real joy to watch him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Almost opposite to <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> White's
Gambling-and-Coffee House he has put a little Gambling-and-Brandy House,
outwardly somewhat different, inwardly and essentially, however, of one and the
same type. This is <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Black's House. Since it has
neither walls nor roof, the landlord cannot hang out his signboard, much less
so brilliant a one as <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> White's; he is satisfied
with painting his name 'Black' upon a post, which together with the tables,
chairs, seats and arm-chairs of the house forms one single continuum. To this
remarkable openness of the building, however, we are indebted for the benefit
of being able to see the customers sitting around, and for being able to read,
on account of the complete similarity of morals and Club regulations, as if in
a convex mirror, what is going on over there behind the thick walls of <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> White's. Anybody raising the smallest claim to poetic
feeling must admire <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> art in this, and I
really cannot call to mind any trait in the works of antiquity comparable with
it, except perhaps in Virgil where the poet lets Aeneas see upon his shield,
through the thick mists of the future, the deeds of his descendants, almost
down to Pope Peter I. It is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutatis
mutandis</i> just the same. What White has dark and walled in over there. Black
shows here illuminated and under the open sky. Thus to read straight <span
class=SpellE>offhere</span> what is happening over there calls for nothing but
eyes and a little knowledge of plus and minus and black and white in which all <span
class=SpellE>colours</span> disappear. The following hints, classified under
the headings, Black and White, will certainly guide the reader through the
whole story. Thus what appears here under Black would be something like
Aeneas's shield, and under White like the Roman history relating to it.</p>

sky. There is little relation between the symbol of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
and <span class=SpellE>honour</span> itself; they are not dependent upon one
another. Each may be doffed separately and, in order to make oneself entirely
comfortable, both together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

suffice to sum up the rest in a few words. One sees that by Black's Coffee
House <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> merely wished to say: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:24.0pt;
mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Here too soup is being cooked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>The
two dice-players stake their belongings against one another, and lo! <span
class=GramE>the</span> dice are hanging in mid-air like Sarah Young's hat-box
and <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> White's lightning. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has put much into that Plate which might— and ought to—hang. The scoundrel with
the white wig who is on the point of becoming a shoe-black with two sets of
instruments, as he has already two sets of clothes, is said to be the portrait
of a French boy who cleaned shoes at the comer of Hog Lane, where it was
doubtless very necessary. The sly fox had chosen the right stand, just as he
chose here the right man. Under his right knee are more dice; perhaps he has
even succeeded in making the tipsy Baron believe he could only play with his
own dice. The strap which is lying there upon his lap may be used for some
game, but perhaps it is only an Order ribbon which the Baron has lost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Behind him sits a player whose face, elsewhere, might make
one think it was hanging. In his hat, whose whole brim has been snipped off,
sticks a note which compensates ten-fold for that loss; a real pearl in the
crown. 'Your vote and interest' it reads, meaning: 'I beg for your vote and
what- ever else you can do for me.' The boy is an Election canvasser, but the
main vocal organ by which he makes his living hangs at his side—a little
trumpet; he is a Post-boy who with that instrument does much trumpeting, and
(translated into White) such a <span class=SpellE>votum</span> may be useful.
Clinging to the canvasser from behind sits a spy who indicates to the man with
the sash how many <span class=SpellE>Honours</span> his opponent holds in his
hand. That item we shall leave entirely black. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>porte</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

his Penny-<span class=SpellE>Moniteur</span>, and smoking his little pipe whose
heat serves also to protect its small <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>, the
nose, against the March air. There is an inexpressible warmth and domesticity
about that little statesman; he does not hear the thunder in the heavens, he
does not see the lightning of the <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
police as it strikes close to Black's Coffee House. Is it possible to look with
greater complaisance into the politics of one's country? All must be well with <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or at least with the nobility to whom the little person belongs. The remainder
of White's Coffee House, which is not shown us in the mirror, we shall soon
investigate when <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> himself takes us there, as
he does in fact in the sixth Plate. </p>

belongs either to the Welshman or to Sarah Young (we shall have more to say
about this later) seems to find so much disorder here in the street among
reasonable beings very unreasonable, and to express his disapproval with
evident signs of astonishment. That is what dogs do; when they are brought into
society they often disapprove of many of its vices, especially the noisier
ones, but as a rule only make matters worse by their objections, because of the
way they express themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

without a rider. Down below lives a saddler who has erected that horse to show
by way of example what a miserable object is a horse without a saddle. With a
similar intention a famous <st1:City><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:City>
dressmaker chose for her signboard a picture of the Venus de Medici to make it
quite clear what contemptible creatures women are if they have no clothes on. </p>

text-autospace:none'>Among the swarm of bees before the Palace entrance stands
a queer figure; it almost seems to have something like a beehive perched upon
its head. An anonymous commentator remarks that it bears a resemblance, though
a very remote one, to the small figure in the Plate '<a
href="../../4xd/4xd2/4xd2small.htm">Noon</a>', who is leaving the French
Chapel. The similarity is indeed very remote; more properly speaking there is
none at all, for the object there was evidently a wig, whether made of human or
goat's or sheep's hair, or carved or formed from plaster of Paris, whereas here
it is evidently a basket perched upon a somewhat short female figure. The
anonymous gentleman did not take into account that it is raining slightly <span
class=GramE>here,</span> and that in the first prints it is said to have rained
much more, and thus it is easy to understand why a girl should dive underneath
an empty basket. It is said that the storm on this picture gave our artist a
lot of trouble. He touched it up so often that it became worse than before and
he had to let another storm blow up whose production he left to a completely
strange hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

is clear. <span class=GramE>But why just 41?</span> That <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
should have chosen that number without a reason is unlikely, indeed I think it
impossible. <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Ireland conjectures, but with the
misgiving and even disapproval which such a doubtful and forced idea deserves,
that it might mean 'four to one', because <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> is
here attacked by four persons, two officers of the law, a thorn bush and a
joker with an oil can. This is some- what crude. But what can it be? The Queen
was born in 1683; <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> in 1698; these Plates
appeared in 1735, and they are not even the forty-first of his works. It may be
therefore that such <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>porte</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>-chaises</i> have their definite stands in
the town and <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> here may have indicated
