    Rakewell, are on their way to a royal levee. (The presence of Welshmen with 
    leeks in their hats tells us that it is March 1, St. David's Day, which was 
    also the birthday of Queen Caroline, and hence the levee.) Rakewell is now 
    a place-seeker, hoping to recoup his losses. The curtains of his sedan chair 
    are drawn as if he hoped to escape notice between his lodgings and the palace 
    But two bailiffs have stopped his sedan chair, and as he emerges in all his 
    court finery they <a href="arrest.htm">arrest him</a> for debt (one holds

  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg: </font></b>The 
    hatter's box as well as the wig-maker's in the <a href="../rake2/rp2small.htm">second 
    Plate</a> have opened, and the tailor's work has unfolded in order to adorn 
    the artistic product of Figg, Essex, Dubois, Pontac and Co for the festive 
    day. The fellow wants to go to Court; to mix with the swarm of bees&#8212;the 
    wasp! He does not appear to have a carriage of his own (remember the sign 
    of the Lion), he chose therefore for the transport of his noble self the cheaper 
    four-legged domestic animal, the porte-chaise. Concealed in it, he believed 
    he would come warm and safe to St James's, there to gaze upon the light of 
    the great world in quite a natural way, like hundreds of others, merely by 
    getting out of his vehicle. But he has miscalculated. Certain events intervene. 
    It is a difficult birth; the dandy is fetched out with forceps on the public 
    highway. One has incurred debts which one is unable to pay and one is arrested. 
    That this event involves not an active but an exceedingly passive descent 
    from the vehicle can be seen from the fact that the fore- most bearer is still 
    holding the two poles, and is only unable to proceed be- cause his hindmost 
    colleague with leek in hat is already occupied in raising the roof of the 
    post-chaise so that Rakewell&#8212;should not ruin his coiffure. Excellent! 
    A <a href="arrest.htm">police officer</a> is presenting to him a strip of 
    paper, hardly a few inches long, but also, simultaneously, a cudgel which 
    is somewhat longer, and that strip of paper acts on our hero as if it were 
    the heavenly beam itself which flashes so brilliantly over there to the accompaniment 
    of thunder. Indeed it is no mean weapon which strikes here, but one of the 
    <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foudres de poche</i> of English Justice 
    which unfailingly find their man, a warrant of arrest; awe-inspiring at any 
    time, but here, introduced by Heaven with a peal of thunder, even terrible! 
    Hamlet, if the ghost had appeared to him when he was leaving a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>porte-chaise,</i> 
    could hardly have been more petrified than Rakewell here. It looks as if the 
    lightning of Heaven had struck him in the literal sense of the word. Electricity-wise 
    persons will find everything they seek here. The hair-bag rises off his shoulders 
    as if standing on end, the fingers are spread like spikes, the eye stares 
    without seeing. He is really struck and knocked out, for the vermin notice 
    it and fall upon him. The mischievous lamplighter intentionally overfills 
    the lamp, and the surplus streams on to Rakewell's festive clothes. That he 
    does this purposely can be surmised from his lower lip, and his eye looking 
    where there is less to see than is below him. However, he does damage like 
    an honest man, without deriving any advantage from it. Not quite so honest 
    as this satirist upon the ladder is a member of the small club which here 
    upon the pavement of a public street is holding its sessions, without any 
    proper seats. He is stealing a hand- kerchief from the poor all-but-prisoner's 
    pocket. This is how that action is usually interpreted. I too have nothing 
    against it, but I should humbly like to advise people to be rather careful 
    in the use of the word 'steal', and in too hastily declaring as theft every 
    means of acquisition without compensation, thereby reducing the number of 
    honest people in the world by half. The incredible legerdemain of the English 
    so-called pick-pocket really does not deserve the name of stealing. In fact 
    the boy here does no more than any thorn-bush in a hedge along the way; he 
    robs not by pulling but by being pulled, and to plunder by mere reaction is 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>eo ipso</i> no longer plunder. After all, it 
    is the officer of the law who is depriving the handkerchief of its master. 
    Londoners are familiar with this sort of thing. If the tiniest bit of a handkerchief 
    is hanging out of some- body's pocket, the very first man who meets him will 
    say: 'Sir, you'll lose your handkerchief,' and not 'Your handkerchief will 
    be stolen.' For shame! who would say such a thing? Indeed, handkerchiefs are 
    not stolen out of pockets there; they are only lost to responsive fingers 
    on the road. It is the constellation of events that matters (226-227). </p>
