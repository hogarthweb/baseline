in Bedlam, insane and on display for the visiting curiosity seekers. Here, the
consequences of <span class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> behavior are painfully
apparent. The future of knowledge is at stake, as <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span>
notes: &quot;Science has claimed two victims ... the fellow peering at the

him the fellow who has <a href="drawing.htm">drawn the ship</a> ... is

This figure is also notable, as he has drawn yet another globe, adding
macrocosmic import to the actions here. Religion is mocked by the <a

either, as <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> believes &quot;urinating&quot;

foreground echoes this and recalls the <a href="../../harlot/23/john.htm">clergyman's
similar accident</a> in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Harlot's

we see symbols of the unnatural, overindulgent and infertile sexuality
dangerous to the future of the Empire. To underscore the timeliness of the
events, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has placed a mad- looking coin of
Britannia in the plate, inscribed with a year, showing, as <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span>
notes, that in &quot;1763 <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> questioned the
sanity of the British nation&quot; (35). Furthermore, even Lichtenberg sees the
world of Bedlam as a &quot;little Republic.&quot; He recalls a contemporary

    </span>Its apparent callousness was an admission of helplessness.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just as infant-mortality was unavoidable, the

    </span>Apart from restraint and confinement, repeated bleedings and strenuous 
    <span

    hidden disorders of the mind; and no attempt was therefore made either to 
    disguise the lunatic’s condition or to segregate him in a world of his own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Not until 1770 did it occur to physicians that the constant influx 
    of inquisitive sightseers “tended to disturb the tranquility of the patients”: 
    and, meanwhile, several generations of distinguished men and women had inspected 
    and admired the building, and marveled at the strange <span class=SpellE>humours</span> 
    displayed by the inhabitants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even 
    Cowper, <span

    the valley of the shadow of madness, admits that he has been there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>“In those days (he writes to Newton, after the hospital had shut its 
    doors) when Bedlam was open to the cruel curiosity of the <a href="tourists.htm">holiday 
    ramblers</a> I have been a visitor . . . Though a boy, I was altogether not 
    insensible of the misery of the poor captives . . . But the madness of some 
    of them had such a humorous air, and displayed itself in so many whimsical 
    freaks, that it was impossible not to be entertained, at the same time that 
    I was angry with myself for being so.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Johnson 
    and Boswell, both introspective and neurotic characters, frequently haunted 
    by the fear of madness, visited Bedlam as late as 1775; and Boswell merely 
    observes that the visit went off without mishap, but that “the general contemplation 
    of insanity was very affecting”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Incidentally, 
    its “indiscriminate admission of visitants” increased the revenues of the 
    hospital by “at least &#8356;400 a year . . .”</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Other details 
    emerge from contemporary records—the wooden bowls in which the lunatics were 
    served with “their appointed messes”: the knavery of nurses and attendants 
    who, on Sundays, put aside a good part of the patients’ food for the benefit 
    of their “ancient relations and most intimate friends who are to come and 
    visit them in the afternoon”:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and the 
    oppressive horror of hot, still nights when the noise of the maniacs within 
    their prison, “rattling their chains and making terrible out-cry”, echoed 
    across <span class=SpellE>Moorfields</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The topical and functional continue 
    to mesh: while the ending in Bedlam follows directly from the <span
class=SpellE>donnée</span>, and appears inevitable, it is probably no coincidence 
    that in 1734-35 the governors in Bethlehem Hospital were soliciting subscriptions 
    to pay off the debt for the new wing built for female incurables.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>The hospital’s historian writes of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>: 
    “I venture, therefore, to suggest that his ‘Bedlam’ picture represents something 
    more than an inevitable episode in the progress of a rake from bad to worse; 
    it looks as though it were also an endorsement of a subscription-book at that 
    time being circulated through the city.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> 
    picture is, however, more ambiguous in its attitude than such an endorsement 
    would be.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He must 
    have visited Bedlam many times, looking at <span class=SpellE>Caius</span> 
    Gabriel <span class=SpellE>Cibber’s</span> statues over the stone piers of 
    the great gate, like Michelangelo’s Night and Morning: Raving Madness (or 
    acute mania), chained, drawing in his breath and about to bellow forth his 
    anger, and Melancholy Madness with a vacant expression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> epitome of Bedlam includes his 
    versions of these statues and depicts the <a href="tourists.htm">visitors</a> 
    as well: they offer the contrast that most impressed him in Bedlam.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As he shows, gates of the open ironwork (erected 
    in 1729) kept the most violent patients separate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Off the gallery on both stories opened the cells 
    or bedrooms of the patients, provided with narrow, unglazed windows high up 
    in the wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These patients were locked 
    in their cells, occasionally taken out in the years for air; some patients 
    were allowed the “liberty of the gallery,” but in general these were reserved 
    for the visitors, who amused themselves by looking into the cells.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>While this voyeurism was acceptable to mid-eighteenth century London, 
    it was especially characteristic of the fashionable folk <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> 
    emulated who now come to observe him.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>All of the 
    details work in this double way: as <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> reports, 
    the mad were kept nearly naked to save clothes (it was cheap, and they might 
    destroy clothing), and slept on straw which was easily cleared away; but these 
    facts became symbols of <a href="madrake.htm">Tom <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span></a><span
class=SpellE>’s</span> reduction to nothingness and connect with a metaphor of 
    apparel that runs through the series.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><a
href="../rake1/tom.htm">Plate 1</a> begins with the tailor measuring him for a 
    suit, with the portrait of the closely-muffled miser in the background.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the elegant <a
href="../rake2/tommourns.htm">dressing-down in 2</a>, <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> 
    descends to <a href="../rake3/drunktom.htm">dishevelment in 3</a> and the 
    elegant attire in which he is <a href="../rake4/rake.htm">arrested in 4</a>; 
    from 6 to the end he is gradually stripped down to the bare forked animal 
    he is in Bedlam—and significantly witnessed by two of the well-dressed denizens 
    of the society he entered in the first plate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>At the same time, while tracing the typical descent from folly to vice, 
    from prison to madness and bestiality, one should notice that the prisoners 
    in the Fleet and the madmen incarcerated in Bedlam are implicitly compared 
    with the fashion-mongers of the earlier plates, <span class=GramE>who</span> 
    are still free.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The madhouse acts as 
    a reflection on the society that has appeared in the earlier plates—people 
    madder than any of the inmates are allowed to come in and observe them; and, 
    as one critic has remarked, “surely the girl, still faithful to her betrayer, 
    is the maddest creature in Bedlam” (vol. 1 326-327).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Some of 
    the flaws of this long, ambitious series are epitomized in this striking final 
    plate, which, in spite of its good qualities, reflects a difficulty of communication.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Most commentators on the plate have recorded, based on what they see, 
    that <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> <span class=GramE>is<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>being</span> chained after suffering a (perhaps suicidal) fit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Certain external evidence, however, argues for his death and the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>un</i>locking of the fetters, no longer needed: 
    the line from the poetic inscription: “Behold Death grappling with Despair.” 
    suggests that he is at least sinking into death, and the poster after a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pietà</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>also implies death.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The general gist of the progress also points 
    to dying rather than struggle as intention; the <a
href="../rake3/theroofisonfire.htm">map of the world set afire by the whore in 
    Plate 3</a> prefigures the Rake’s being consumed not only by lust but by infection 
    as well—part of the rake syndrome, and an obsessive consequence in <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> works (the Harlot too died of syphilis).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nevertheless, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    has certainly put <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> in a peculiar posture: 
    alluding to <span class=SpellE>Cibber’s</span> statue of Melancholy Madness 
    in the figure, while ironically alluding to a <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pietà</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>in the group.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The confusion 
    is evident in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> small revisions in the shoulders 
    and even the head of the Rake, and in the hands of the warden; most strikingly, 
    he changes the warden in the final state of the print (made many years later, 
    in 1763) to a clergyman, as if he recognized the ambiguity (vol. 1 333).</p>

bed-and-board side. His physique might have withstood it, but his mind, which
was never his strongest part, succumbed in the end. It was surmised earlier

erected as tombstones over the grave of their reason. <span class=GramE>Tombstones?</span>
Merciful Heavens! What comparisons do not spring to mind between the eloquent
marble raised over the ashes of the masterpiece of creation, and the filthy,
numbered stables here where his image, in greater likeness than on those marble
stones, chained and lying on rotten straw, tells the passer-by still more
eloquently how much lies buried there! But this is not the place for such

text-autospace:none'><span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> lies in the foreground
here, naked for the most part, while a man is putting him in chains. The reason
for it is that <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> is sinking still deeper. In
the <span class=SpellE>Microcosmos</span> where he lives now, affairs are ordered
very much as they are in the extended Macro-Bedlam, the world itself; not all
the madmen are chained, and even the chains have their degrees. Through the
long corridor, the catacomb, which we see here, the more harmless are free to
walk about, at least as far as the big grating, behind which lives another
class, or sect as it is called in ordinary life, having other principles, not
in agreement with those on this side of the iron bars; only those of a still
lower and more dangerous degree are buried in the numbered cells. Evidently <span
class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> had such freedom to start with, but misused it. He
began to adopt other principles and, in a mood which we might call exuberant,
has given himself a dangerous stab in the region of the heart. He no longer
fitted into that little Republic and now is about to be incorporated into
another. It is that moment of promotion which our artist has chosen here. The
expression of suffering is indescribable, and it is hard to understand how a
man like Gilpin, who otherwise does justice to the drawing, could have found
that face empty. <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Ireland fully appreciates our
artist. The late <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Mortimer, a person of the
greatest artistic talent, was, as Ireland relates, once asked to draw some of
the Passions as Gray presents them successively in his poem, 'Ode on a distant
prospect of Eton College'. Among them was </p>

again <a href="sarah.htm">Sarah Young</a>, sympathizing with his <span

trait unnatural and the moral reprehensible. To be sure! It would perhaps have
been better if after <span class=SpellE>Rakewell's</span> marriage the girl had
not appeared again. I too thought so once, and <span class=SpellE>Mr</span>
Gilpin, as a clergyman, is doubly deserving of forgiveness. But the notion is
and remains more readily thought than experienced; it is a good instance of
conduct for those who like to live by examples yet do not always have one
handy. But the heart, the heart—has its own rules. True love, especially in the
heart of a gentle woman but of strong feeling, can only be extinguished, if it
can ever be extinguished, which I rather doubt, by a very great lapse of time,
whatever else its fate may be. If this is so, is there anything unnatural here?
It would be little to the <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of human nature if
such love were unnatural. <span class=GramE>But what of the reprehensible
aspect?</span> This too clearly lies only in the breaking of frigid rules of
conduct, of which the heart knows nothing. It would be a wicked world in which
trespassing of this sort did not happen occasionally. But, of course, a still
wickeder one if a sly imitation of such <span class=SpellE>honourable</span>
trespassing were to find just that forgiveness or even pity to which only the
original could lay claim. In this way, alas! art has made it almost hazardous
for man to be natural Besides, we must remember here that Sarah Young, a
good-natured, simple creature, is not of that social standing where early
enough a girl is taught a certain semblance of virtue, which stands to its true
exercise in the relation of smartness on parade to courage and bravery in the
field. The whole value of the former (and indeed it is very valuable) rests
ultimately upon the possibility of giving support to the latter, or here and
there compensating <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>praeter</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>propter</span></i> for
the lack of it. Without that possibility it would all be hollow machinery. If <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> Gilpin had once preached before such people on the text,
'I was sick and in prison and ye have not visited me', how would he have
judged, and have had to judge a female member of his congregation who after the
sermon would have been so incautious with her heart as to enter the Fleet and
Bedlam like Sarah Young, without any hope of earthly reward? The answer, I
think, is quite simple. One of the warders, who of course may not quite realize
their relationship, seems to be touched by the girl's suffering. He tries to
avert her face from <span class=SpellE>Rakewell</span> in a way that does <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> to his feeling. It is pleasing to see that the man's
hands, despite the hard use for which they are paid, have not unlearned such <span

Are they perhaps ladies of the Court? They are just being received in audience,
and at the same time receive from a distance a benediction which they accept
with much better grace than was intended. Each clings to the other, and through
that support finds the strength to look at what by herself she would not even

want to stay perhaps? Or like Sarah Young to clothe the naked? <span

Each is a world to himself and none provides light for the others, and none
eclipses the other; each has its own light. If there is anyone who does not yet
know that it is the head which makes the world and not the world which makes
the head, he should look here. Merciful Heaven, what is man? Or rather what is
the world? 'But are you aware that you are sitting in a lunatic asylum?' asked
a man once in exasperation of a maniac whom he wanted to convert, upon which
the latter looked at him with the greatest composure and retorted, 'But are you
sure that you are not living in one?' The stranger pondered this and was
silent, the maniac was silent too, but probably his capacity for pondering had
vanished long ago. What became of him afterwards is not known. The stranger, however,
after he had stepped out of the asylum into the world again, is said to have
realized that there was between the two worlds, instead of a sharp dividing
line, a sort of no-man's-land, and to have been on his guard all his life from

from a glade to serve here as banisters: 'Charming Betty Careless.' Of course

shares with the rest of the world, and are nothing unusual. </p>

rather <span class=SpellE>encyclopaedic</span> appearance, at least in comparison

ship, a crescent moon</a>, a projection of the globe with the Antarctic circle
still vacant but having most of the remainder covered by Britannia, more
precisely by an English halfpenny hanging from a chain; a bomb-shell which is
projected beyond all these projections, the lower part of which looking rather
like a compass, and the upper part like geometrical hyphens. All this, with the
exception of the medal which, as we shall hear, was daubed on it twenty-eight
years later by a notorious rogue, seem to be the work of the thinker who with
charcoal in hand is still occupied in prolonging one of the strokes, which, if
he goes on like that, will soon reach the door of number fifty-five. Just in front
of his nose we read the word 'longitude'. This is really the name <span
class=GramE>of a</span> certain <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charming
Betty</i> of another sort whose luckless lovers, alas! <span class=GramE>haunt</span>
the walls of Bedlam to this very day. The good lady demanded from her suitors
neither wealth nor beauty nor possessions; there was just as little mention of
family trees as of acres, and least of all youth. To possess her and her gold
she merely demanded the solution of a puzzle. The affair caused an incredible
sensation, and the result was for many the most melancholy in the world. Some
who only wished to possess the lady proved tolerably lucky; others who wooed
her only for the sake other money puzzled themselves silly, entangled
themselves in ropes and strokes and calculation and tricks, which in the end
they themselves no longer understood, and so not uncommonly ended their lives
in Bedlam. The strokes which our man is making here are of that sort, and the
shells which he causes to be thrown all aim at the acquisition of that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Charming Longitude.</i> The old man behind
him too, who is peering through the rolled-up <a href="astronomer.htm">astronomical
chart</a>, is not really looking at the sky, but towards that same beauty, and
is the rival of the <span class=SpellE>bombadier</span>. In front of him, a <a
href="tailor.htm">tailor</a> squats upon his heels with the pattern card upon
his head, like the violinist with his music book. He is almost bursting with
laughter over the vain efforts of the two longitude-seekers, and his mockery is
aimed especially at the old man with the scroll. 'Fool,' he seems to say,
'look, like this you must cut your paper and hold it if you want to measure
length; that is how I find my longitudes, and compared with them yours are mere
child's play.' Nor is he so far out, since the old man's methods for
discovering longitudes are of just as little use to geography as to the art of
tailoring. That one fool laughs at another is, of course, silly enough, but not
uncommon, either within or without the lunatic asylum, but there is something
more to it here. It is said that at that time there was in fact a tailor in
Bedlam who believed that to cut out a garment for the master- piece of
creation, which would fit the beautiful form as the beautiful form fitted the
beautiful soul, was not only one of the most important occupations for a
rational person, but also immeasurably more difficult than, say. <span
class=GramE>Sir Isaac Newton's unprofitable arts.</span> That is why the poor
devil is here. The punishment is hard, especially <span class=GramE>for a</span>
tailor, a creature who as a reward for 'making' men, in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zona</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>temperata</span></i> at least, is made fun of at

class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zona</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>torrida</span>,</i> who
have neither morals nor tailors. The medal on the wall is, as mentioned above,
the reverse of an English halfpenny. It represents a seated Britannia with
somewhat <span class=SpellE>dishevelled</span> hair, and bears the date 1763.
If one looks a little more closely, one notices a chain which passes from under
the medal on the right towards number fifty-four. There would have been more
room for the chain above it. But a medal with the chain above would hang <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i> the <span class=GramE>chain,</span>
and in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the words ‘hang’ and 'chain', even if used of medals, readily remind one of
more important things than orders and child's play. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
thus meant to say: in the year 1763 Britannia was, or deserved to be, in chains
in Bedlam. The Glorious Peace concluded at that time seemed, to some, much too
peaceful; it should have been much more bellicose, they thought, and would then
have been still more glorious. Britannia could have done better, said one; she
ought to have been cleverer, said another; she deserves to be in a lunatic
asylum, said <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ecce <span class=SpellE>Signum</span>.</i> There stands the blasphemy,
and in a language, besides, which the whole world can understand, and in a
Plate which the whole world will buy. Nay, what makes the crime still worse and
qualifies the author if not for the block, at least to be an inmate of the
Bastille for life, is that it was not a youthful escapade of his. A year before
his death, in the sixty-fifth year of his life when he ought to have known
better, and after that Plate had already existed for twenty-eight years, he
arranged for Britannia to have a place on it. Still worse, he advertised the
fact that he had only put her here in the year 1763, whereas the Plate dates
from 1735. Thereby the rascal seems in addition to indicate that he dreaded far
more to be accorded by posterity the venerable epithet of a new prophet, than
that of a traitor by his contemporaries. That was very wicked. But are we
looking at it properly? Is that really so? In such cases experience may help.
What did wise Britannia do when she learnt of it? She did what might be a fair
rule for every less wise and less experienced Patria. The wise and good mother
smiled at the idea of a beloved child whose heart she knew, and she forgave.
Thus to learn to know hearts and how to deserve their homage, that would be the
thing; wit is but a feather.</p>
