href="../../harlot/18/bawd.htm">“Mother” Needham</a> who initiates her charge’s
destruction, &quot;Gin Lane&quot; gives us a fatally negligent mother
prominently foregrounded in the plate. Her consumption of the vile substance
has led her to <a href="droppedbaby.htm">drunkenly release her nursling</a> to
his death. Derek Jarrett comments that this scene was not an uncommon
phenomenon as “Gin was often taken, quite literally, with the mother’s milk” (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England </i>63) <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He further notes that &quot;Other children,
perhaps more fortunate, survived to take gin in a more direct form. . . .<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1769, William Buchan's immensely popular
tract 'Domestic Medicine' asserted that half of the children who died in London
each year were killed by laudanum, spirits or proprietary sedatives&quot; (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>England </i>63).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While Buchan's figures are likely an
exaggeration, the awareness of a correlation between infant mortality and gin
consumption is one that clearly concerned Hogarth and his contemporaries. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Gin consumption was associated most explicitly
with the poor; Hogarth himself comments that the plate and its companion piece,
&quot;<a href="../beer/beerstsmall.htm">Beer Street</a>&quot; were designed to
&quot;reform some reigning vices peculiar to the lower class of people&quot;
and that &quot;Beer St and Gin Lane were done when the dreadful consequences of
gin drinking was at its height. In gin lane every circumstance of its horrid
effects are brought to view . . . nothing but (idleness) poverty misery and
ruin are to be seen Distress even to madness and death and not a home in
tolerable condition but <a href="pawn.htm">Pawnbrokers</a> and the <a
href="sign.htm">Gin shop</a>” (qtd. in Uglow 497).<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>While the gin drinkers are
themselves pitable, the most dramatic and tragic aspect of this plate is the
effect of this mass drunkenness on the children of the town. The gleefully
drunk center figure is not particularly alarming herself, but her child
plunging to his death is horrifying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
one side of a print, a <a href="kids.htm">mother forces gin</a> down the throat
of another infant, recalling Buchan's frightening statistics.<span

forced to share a bone with a dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>As Moll 
    was either ignored by her potential benefactors (or seduced into prostitution 
    by them), the children of Gin Lane are clearly suffering for the sins of the 
    parents. The blame again falls not on any individual figure here, but on the 
    social conditions which lead to and encourage the behavior exhibited. Although 
    Shesgreen notes that “The instances of the mother compelling her child to 
    drink and the two unaccompanied girls taking liquor suggest that Hogarth saw 
    gin addiction as growing out of social as well as individual causes,&quot; 
    the emphasis is on the social (76).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As 
    Hogarth's lower classes would have recognized and as Paulson points out, “Beer 
    drinking is a product of prosperity and gin drinking of want&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Popular </i>6). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Furthermore, unlike 
    Hogarth's other print series which develop one character to trace his or her 
    downfall, “Gin Lane” presents us with a montage of alcoholism; there is no 
    one figure here to despise, no lone figure clearly acting on individual impulses. 
    Rather, there seem to be no alternatives in the plate, no options from which 
    to choose. Individuals can be condemned for selecting bad behavior, but acting 
    without alternative affords less culpability. The fault then rests, if Paulson 
    is correct, on that most ultimate of supposed benefactors—the paternal state 
    for allowing such a divide to exist between the prosperous and the wanting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    drinking, we find (besides the <a href="sign.htm">distiller</a>) only the 
    <a
href="pawn.htm">pawnbroker</a> who permits, indeed encourages, these people to 
    drink themselves to death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only 
    other hint is the distant church spire, which indicates an absence rather 
    than an active cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth has chosen 
    the church of St. George’s Bloomsbury, the one London church with a king on 
    its steeple (George I), and had substituted by an optical illusion the pawnbroker’s 
    sign in the foreground for the cross.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
    fortuitous grouping materializes a sign of the conjoined authority of church, 
    state, and pawnbroker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the local 
    representative of church and state, the pawnbroker allows the drinking to 
    go on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me suggest that this peripheral 
    detail, this “mistake” in the employment of compositional perspective (of 
    the sort Hogarth ridiculed in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>False Perspective</i>) would be seen by a naïve viewer, unconcerned with 
    laws of perspective, in a surer and more immediate way than by the reader 
    of Fielding’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Enquiry</i>—and carries 
    a message quite outside the range of Fielding’s argument.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A church 
    steeple is closer and more prominent in the pedant <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="../beer/beerstsmall.htm">Beer Street</a>,</i> and the king is 
    manifested front-center in George II’s printed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="../beer/speech.htm">Address to Parliament</a>,</i> which is being 
    read by fat, prosperous tradesmen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 
    king’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Address</i> offers plans for 
    the “Advancement of our Commerce,” which in terms of the metaphor of fat/beer 
    versus thin/gin means making them fatter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two prints are as much about the absence 
    of royal/ecclesiastical authority as about the drinking of beer or gin.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The fact 
    is that the government encourages distillation and sales of gin in order to 
    support the landed interest (encourage the production of spirits distilled 
    from home-grown cereals) and provide itself with revenues.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As one historian of gin has concluded, “the 
    rise and decline of gin drinking can be related directly to taxation and legislation.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>In 1743 Parliament repealed the 1736 Gin Act and adopted a more moderate 
    one, drafted by a prominent distiller of the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Lord Bathurst’s argument was that since it was impossible to prevent 
    the retailing of spirits, it would be better to license it instead, as this 
    would reduce usage by increasing expense and also provide money for the European 
    wars.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new law, known as the Tippling Act, increased 
    the price of gin, granted licenses only to alehouse license holders, and forbade 
    distillers to retail.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in 1747 the 
    distillers petitioned for the right to retail, and the act was modified accordingly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Once this right was restored to the distillers, gin consumption, which 
    had waned slightly since 1743, rose markedly; drunkenness increased, population 
    declined, and in 1750 a commission reported that in some parts of London one 
    in every five houses was a ginshop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether 
    or not Hogarth had this information, he assumes some such situation when he 
    includes the spire of St. George’s in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gin 
    Lane</i> and juxtaposes with this print of the emaciated gin drinkers the 
    prosperity of the fat merchants in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beer 
    Street.</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The basic cause and effect relationship would 
    be understood by the poor: not that beer drinking leads to prosperity and 
    gin drinking to want, but the reverse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rather, 
    beer drinking is a product of prosperity and gin drinking of want.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another 
    pair of details is relevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 
    background of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beer Street</i> a fat, 
    encumbered upper-class woman is being <a href="../beer/carriage.htm">crushed 
    in her too-tight sedan chair</a> (related to the fat beer drinkers in the 
    foreground), and in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gin Lane</i> a <a
href="coffin.htm">poor, emaciated dead woman lies in her coffin</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each woman has two attendants and a box to hold 
    her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such details may have been overlooked 
    by the audience of responsible citizens to which Fielding addresses himself, 
    but the poor would have seen them straightaway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And once the women are seen as a pair, the fat 
    one becomes a cause of the emaciated, dead one, as do the fat, beer-drinking 
    purveyors of essential commodities in the foreground.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The two 
    plates convey an implied contrast between the state’s paternalist duty to 
    regulate on the old mercantilist basis and the new ideal of supply and demand 
    in a free market (“advance our commerce,” as the king’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Address</i> says) which wishes to regulate itself and determine its own 
    level of profit and cost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Whereas 
    the first appeals to a moral norm—what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ought</i> 
    to be men’s reciprocal duties—the second appears to say: ‘This is the way 
    things work, or would work if the State did not interfere.’”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the point of view of eighteenth-century 
    bread rioters, the assumed the shape of the man (here the pawnbroker, but 
    any merchant) who seeks private gain at the expense of his own neighbors, 
    who accordingly can only riot or sink into gin and crime.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the poor man of this period, as Francis 
    Place wrote, “none but the animal sensations are left; to these his enjoyments 
    are limited, and even these are frequently reduced to two—namely sexual intercourse 
    and drinking . . . Of the two . . . drunkenness is by far the most desired” 
    since it provides a longer period of escape and costs only a penny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The people of Gin Lane could not have afforded 
    beer; gin alone was within their competence (5-7).</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>By implication, all Gin Lane’s world 
    of hunger and want is rejected in Beer Street, as the verses under Brueghel’s 
    print emphasize: “Beat it, Thinman!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Though 
    you are hungry, you are wrong,/ This is Fat Kitchen here, and here <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> 
    don’t belong!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do not know to what extent we can extrapolate 
    the content from the model in this case; Brueghel’s prints cannot have affected 
    Hogarth’s popular audience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they 
    do draw our attention to the extremes of fat and thin, of eating and starving 
    in Hogarth’s plates (250).</p>

    to those of Hogarth’s time, and are aptly described in the London daily press:--“The 
    expense incurred in fitting up gin-shop bars in London is almost incredible, 
    every one vying with his neighbour in convenient arrangements, general display, 
    rich carvings, brass work, finely-veined mahogany, gliding, and ornamental 
    painting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The carving of one ornament 
    alone in the Grapes gin-shop, Old Street Road, cost £100: the workmanship 
    was by one of the first carvers in wood in London.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Three gin-shops have been lately fitted up in Red Lion Street, at an 
    expense, for the bar alone, of upwards of £2000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Time was when gin was only to be found in by-lanes and blind alleys—in 
    dirty obscure holes, ‘yclep’d dram-shops; but now gin has become a giant demi-god, 
    a mighty spirit, dwelling in gaudy gold-beplastered temples, erected to his 
    honour in every street, and worshipped by countless thousands, who daily sacrifice 
    at his shrine their health, their strength, their money, their minds, their 
    bodies, wives, children, sacred home, and liberty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Juggernaut is but a good to him; for the devotees of Juggernaut, though 
    they put themselves into the way of being crushed to death beneath his chariot 
    wheels, are put out of their misery at once; but the devotees of the great 
    spirit of Gin, devote themselves to lingering misery: for his sake they are 
    contented to drag on a degraded, nasty existence—to see their children pine, 
    dwindle, and famish; to steep themselves in poverty to the very lips; and 
    die at last poor, sneaking, beadle-kicked, gruel-swoln paupers!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>In these temples of the great spirit Gin, may be seen maudlin, unwashed 
    multitudes—the ancient, and the infant of a span long, old men and maidens, 
    grandsires and grandams, fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, and children, 
    crowding, jostling, and sucking in the portions of the spirit which the flaunting 
    priestesses dole out to them in return for their copper offerings” (130).</p>

    a pawnbroker's house and a church steeple in the distance. In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beer Street</i> a barrel of beer is suspended 
    from a building, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gin Lane</i> it 
    is a coffin (the one from a warehouse, the other from an undertaker's). Life, 
    love, eating, and growth are the subjects of the one; death, apathy, starvation, 
    and decay of the other. The church spire in this case belongs to St. George 
    Bloomsbury, and while the spire signalized the prosperity of the neighborhood

    glimpse of a Good in this world-distant and inaccessible over piles of ruins. 
    Another norm against which to judge this activity, the healthy baby falling 
    to its death from its mother's arms, has been withdrawn in the third state 
    by Hogarth's turning it into another denizen of Gin Lane. It is dead before 
    it falls. Dickens pointed out, characteristically, that besides the pawnbroker 
    the only sober person in the print is the beadle, &quot;and he is mightily 
    indifferent to the orphan-child crying beside its parent's coffin.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
