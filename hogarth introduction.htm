<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Why
<span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>One
of my very first classes in graduate school was a course devoted to William
Blake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There I discovered something that
is abundantly obvious to Blake scholars but was completely novel to me: the
centrality of the engravings to the overall purpose and meaning of Blake’s
art.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, I had seen some of the
plates from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Songs</i> but had considered
them only as supplementary to the poems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Never had I considered the visual element an essential component of the
literary one, and one without which Blake’s message cannot be understood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This often unholy union of text and image is
fascinating, creating many valuable teaching moments as my students ponder the
seeming smile on the face of Blake’s tiger while contemplating the beautiful
ferocity of “The <span class=SpellE>Tyger</span>.” Indeed, these moments where
visual art and the written word intersect have proven to be the most effective
in provoking students to consider what comprises a “text” and to challenge
their assumptions about how one “reads” a narrative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The
intersection of literature with the visual arts becomes even more interesting
when there are few or no words to accompany the pictures—the situation one
encounters when dealing with William <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was through Blake that I was directed to
the engravings of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although critics such as Karl <span
class=SpellE>Kroeber</span> <a name=Kroeber>(in <i>British</i></a><i> Romantic
Art</i>), contrast the Romanticism of Blake with the Realism of someone like <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>, the two are closer to being kindred spirits that
their widely diverging styles would immediately suggest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both sought to redeem engraving from its
reputation as reproductive and therefore inferior.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both wove social and political criticism into
their works.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both merged the visual and
the literary—though Blake sometimes produced engravings without much
illustration, just as <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> presented pictures
without accompanying text.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most
importantly, both coax one out of the passivity of reading into the active
search for meaning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
flurry of commentators often disagree and sometimes neglect details—leaving
students and scholars alike to ponder his never-accidental placement of objects
and characters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, with this interest
in demonstrating the literary qualities and the narrative technique often
apparent in the visual media, it seemed natural to move from a study of Blake
into a focus on <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such qualities are the reason why just as
many scholars of literature are interested in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
as are art historians.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Towards
An Online Edition<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>To
my surprise, my initial conference presentations on <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
invited not only comments about my specific papers but also just as many
general concerns from teachers who wished to use <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
in their classrooms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their trepidation
focused on the large amount of background reading one must do to be “fluent” in
<span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>: a consideration of the plates themselves to
determine points of discussion as well as a survey of what other commentators
have observed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was also the issue
of getting the engravings into a form that was truly effective for in-class
observation; slides or website image galleries are fine for looking at the
plates or series as a whole but cannot be used for impromptu close-ups based on
students’ desires to see an obscure background image.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only solution was for each instructor to
“slice” smaller pieces from the larger plates using picture-editing software,
but the process can be labor intensive and requires not only the software but
also a certain degree of computer literacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>I
therefore surmised that it would be effective to provide all of these desired
features in one place, either on a CD-ROM or a website, that could be a
time-efficient, inexpensive (if not free) resource.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are currently websites for information
on <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> aimed at a scholarly audience, including <span
class=SpellE>Georg</span> <span class=SpellE>Olms’s</span> “The Site for
Research on William <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>” (<a
href="http://www.fortunecity.de/lindenpark/hundertwasser/517/index.html#first">http://www.fortunecity.de/lindenpark/hundertwasser/517/index.html#first</a>),
which presents an extensive annotated bibliography of research on the artist as
well as links to numerous image galleries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The site is useful in providing information on both new publications and
classic commentaries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shaun <span
class=SpellE>Wourm’s</span> wide-ranging “<span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
Realm,” (<a href="http://juliette.nfrance.com/~ju8655/hogarth/index.php">http://juliette.nfrance.com/~ju8655/hogarth/index.php</a>)
features a near-complete image gallery and includes commentary on selected
plates as well as articles about <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> life and
times, book recommendations, a message board for questions, and suggestions for
<span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>-related stops when one tours London.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>A
CD-ROM of many of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> engravings is also
available from Graphic Type Limited, a British font and graphics company (<a
href="http://www.graphictype.co.uk/nhogarth.htm">http://www.graphictype.co.uk/nhogarth.htm</a>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The disc costs approximately £40 and includes
brief commentaries on the plates and series, a booklet on “The Life and Times
of William <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>” and scans of over one hundred
plates in three different levels of quality: high resolution (600 dots per
inch), medium resolution (300 dpi) and “screen” resolution (72 dpi).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Billed as royalty-free, the images can be
freely used in other projects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Finally,
a “low-tech” way of bringing <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> into the
classroom is to have each student purchase Sean <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen’s</span>
seminal and affordable <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Engravings of <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span></i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,
the teacher who is using the plates as a one-day supplement or as brief graphic
illustration of larger literary themes may be reluctant to add the work to a
required book list.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, the
music history professor who confessed he would enjoy incorporating <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Rake’s
Progress</i> into a discussion of Stravinsky’s opera would find <span
class=SpellE>Shesgreen’s</span> book of limited use in his course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>All
of these works are excellent at what they do, but none serves as the ideal
resource for novice students and seasoned professors alike in an easily
accessible and <span class=SpellE>assimilable</span> format.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This edition, then, attempts to combine what
is useful about all of the above resources and to provide something new: the
ability to enlarge specific components of each plate to view commentary on very
detailed elements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This online,
annotated edition of many of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> major
engraving series provides the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Blithely
ignoring warnings about its time-consuming nature as well as caveats about the
lack of closure involved in any web project, I began this online edition by
pondering which engravings would be the focus of the initial version.<span

Harlot’s Progress, <span class=GramE>The</span> Rake’s Progress</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marriage <span class=SpellE>à</span> la Mode</i>
were immediate and obvious choices because of their centrality among <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> works.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
wealth of commentary on these three series is astoundingly comprehensive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the two progresses provide
interesting contrast, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marriage </i>continues
<span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> mixture of personal tragedy mixed with

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The
other inclusions required a bit more contemplation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ultimately, I selected <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Four Times of the Day</i> because of its important themes: the
frigid loneliness of hypocritical piety in “Morning”; the need for a happy
medium between lewd public groping and stolid affectation in “Noon”; the
warning of the emasculation and feminization of British men in “Evening”; and
the reminder that leaders must provide a proper example in “Night.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also selected <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i> not only because it is <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> most graphic series, but it is also the one that
carries his most harshly delivered social criticism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tom Nero progresses from torturing animals to
murdering his pregnant mistress in scenes that grow increasingly brutal in
their depictions of violence, but the most horrifying scene is the
state-sanctioned cruelty administered to Tom in an impassive impartation of
“revenge” presided over by an insensitive, detached and frighteningly
omnipotent figure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
startling conclusion is again a warning about the necessity for British leaders
to practice the virtues expected of the British populace; he reveals that Tom
Nero is merely the product of a government that, while decrying crime, permits
the execution and dismemberment of its own citizens. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the necessity for their inclusion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Ideally,
other plates and series could be eventually added.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most particularly, I am eager to work on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Industry and Idleness </i>and <i

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>After
determining which plates would be the focus of this project, I then had to
determine which commentaries would provide the best, most wide-ranging and
comprehensive discussion of the plates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ronald Paulson was an obvious choice; his vitally important work on <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> is consulted and cited by almost everyone who
considers the artist’s work, from the undergraduate to the scholar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, his <span class=GramE>observations
of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> often-complex allusions to other
art—both to individual works and to particular movements—is</span>
unparalleled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another easy decision was
to include Sean <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span>—probably the most widely
distributed current commentator.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Shesgreen’s</span> paperback edition of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span>
engravings provides an excellent overview of and introduction to the plates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:
"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Georg</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> Lichtenberg’s extensive commentary,
originally published in 1794-1835, has always been a personal favorite.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Certainly the most verbose of the
commentators, his meanderings through the plates have frequent nuggets of
invaluable observation as well as bursts of irrepressible humor (One notable
example is when he calls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marriage <span
class=SpellE>à</span> la Mode</i>’s Lord <span class=SpellE>Squanderfield</span>
a “sick angora rabbit beside a hot lady hedgehog”—an epithet one rarely hears
in the description of hedgehogs).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>John
Ireland and Reverend John <span class=SpellE>Trusler</span> provide additional
commentary from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and were also clear
selections.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The large amount of work on <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> in the twentieth century gave me a wealth of
information from which to choose; my ultimate decisions rested on whether the
work features extended discussion of a large number of plates.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Journal articles tend to be too narrow in
focus; most overviews, while frequently informative in their own right, are too
generalized in their approach to specific engravings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ultimately, I selected commentaries by Peter <span
class=SpellE>Quennell</span> and Austin Dobson.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally, I decided to include Jenny <span class=SpellE>Uglow’s</span> <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hogarth</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>: <span class=GramE>A</span> Life and a
World</i>, a work that goes beyond its biographical focus to provide unique,
astute and enlightening insights into the major engravings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In
addition to collecting the commentary of others, my other major task was to
compose my own observations of the selected plates.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fortunately, I had been accumulating these
interpretations through my preparation for years of conference
presentations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, many of these
comments have also been audience tested, and, I have found that some of my
readings are novel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One particular
example, my assertion that the <a href="harlot/20/cat.htm">cat</a> under Moll <span
class=SpellE>Hackabout’s</span> bed in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="harlot/20/hp3small.htm">A Harlot’s Progress<span style='font-style:normal'>,
Plate 3</span></a></i> is actually indicating the presence of Moll’s hiding
lover, seems to be provoking new discussion about the plate and the
implications of this particular elucidation in the overall themes manifested in
the work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My purpose, then, is not to
simply survey and condense the remarks of other commentators but also to step
into the role of commentator myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Both
my interpretations and those of my chosen commentators had to then be placed
into documents compatible with hypertext mark-up language (HTML) format.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While my own discussion of the plates could
be culled from existing files or created from scratch, the acquisition of the
other commentaries proved more difficult than I had initially expected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At first, I believed that scanning the texts
into Rich Text Format or Microsoft Word files for editing would be the most
simple and effortless route.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I
greatly underestimated the amount of proofreading required due to the
inadequacies of Optical Character Recognition in accurately capturing the text
of older books with unfamiliar typefaces.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Early efforts yielded numerous errors and formatting problems.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other books were in such delicate condition
that scanning was rendered difficult, if not impossible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ultimately determined that manually
entering much of the text myself would allow me to check the accuracy as I
progressed and to preserve the crumbling pages of some of the volumes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, I would have the opportunity to
review carefully the specific content of the material in preparation for what
particulars would be imported into the text components of the enlargements (or
“slices”) of specific details in the plates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I progressed very slowly through this labor-intensive part of the
project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>With
the majority of the text in place, it was time to turn my attention to
acquiring the images.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the best
results, the plates had to be saved in two resolutions: a high-resolution (600
dpi) version used for enlargements and a lower resolution that would load
quickly for the screen shots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had
scanned many of the plates and imported them into Microsoft PowerPoint slides
for previous conference presentations, but I found that most of these images
were not clear enough for use in this project.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Experimenting with many sources for the images (glossy pictures,
reductions of large versions of the plates and enlargements of smaller versions
of the plates among them), I found it fairly simple to obtain a useable screen
version but quite difficult to acquire images that would produce clear enough
detail for several of the enlargements of particulars from the plates.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, in the Beta version of this site,
image quality was an immediate and pressing concern.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was finally able to resolve many of the
issues of image clarity by purchasing and using the CD-ROM version of <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> engravings (referenced above).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also found that the photo editor made a
distinct difference in the quality of the images; using a web graphics editor
like Macromedia’s Fireworks produced the sharpest, clearest representations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Having
obtained all of the raw materials, I could now enjoy the wizardry of combining
them into an effective, easily navigated teaching and research tool.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When considering the overall format of the
pages, several imperatives immediately sprung to mind:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I definitely wanted an always-present
navigation bar on the screen so users could easily return from whence they came
without having to weave through a maze of “back paging.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another important concern was how the
information would be presented.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
considered it a priority to provide users with a text-only page as an overview
of the entire plate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another detail was
to provide “thumbnail” version of each plate for users for whom words such as “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Harlot’s Progress</i>, Plate 5” do not
conjure up an immediate image of the engraving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Bookmarks” were also created on each page so one can quickly find the
work of any particular commentator without having to scroll through the entire
text.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My comments on the plate had to be
made distinct from the observations of the other commentators, so a rule bar
was employed to separate the two.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
revised edition of the site, I further distinguished my comments by placing
them in different font.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>One
of the main features of the site, and one of the reasons I undertook this
project, is the ability to provide one with comments about specific details in
each plate. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The method by which this
could be accomplished was not immediately obvious, but after much deliberation,
I decided to imbed links within the screen shots that would direct the user to
other pages featuring an enlarged image of the particular detail and its
accompanying commentary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This decision
proved to be time consuming, as a web page had to be created for each detail I
planned to discuss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of the thirty-two
plates chosen, each averaged about ten “slices,” yielding over 350 web pages
associated with the project.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I quickly
discovered that any small change I made to font or image size had to be made
350 times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The web pages were built
using a combination of Microsoft Word’s web editing functions for the textual
elements and <span class=SpellE>Dreamweaver</span> for the overall structure
and design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Next,
I considered it an aesthetic necessity to make it abundantly clear on the
full-plate screen shots which elements could be clicked on for further, more
focused, examination and discussion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
best, most appealing method was to create a “mouse-over” effect using
Fireworks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each screen shot had to be
copied and pasted behind the original.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The saturation level of the copy was then adjusted as desired.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Slices were then made on the original picture
that, when <span class=SpellE>moused</span> over, revealed the red-tinted
copy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Typically, it is impossible to
tell that the saturated image is actually a distinct copy of the original
rather than the phenomenon of the original itself turning red.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, as I discovered through a few
missteps, if the images are not perfectly aligned, the mouse will reveal a
picture quite different than the one on screen! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Finally,
I reexamined the commentaries to find discussion of the specific details I had
selected and added those to the appropriate pages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The addition of a detailed works cited page
completed this phase of the project.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Already, though, I am contemplating future features for upgrades,
including a site-wide search mechanism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Certainly, those who warned me about the lack of closure in a web-based
environment were correct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fortunately,
the medium also makes adjustments relatively simple in ways that additions to
text-based projects never are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>My
hope for <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> Online is that it makes significant
contributions to the emerging field of humanities computing, to
eighteenth-century studies and to scholarship on <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also anticipate that the works of this
inimitable engraver will be more readily brought into classrooms where his work
will be more easily examined and understood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>By removing the barrier of extensive advance preparation, I wish to
inspire teachers who are not art historians or even scholars of the eighteenth
century to employ the invaluable glimpses <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
provides into his era and its concerns.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For those with research interests, the overview of the major
commentaries and the links showing relationships between plates and series
will, I hope, prompt further investigation into the artist and his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
