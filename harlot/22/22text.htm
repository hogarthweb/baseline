the doctors’ mistreatment of a patient for their own fame and fortune.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the dying Moll <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span>
is attended by two physicians.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although
Peter <span class=SpellE>Quennell</span> identifies the <a href="man1.htm">corpulent
one</a> as Spot Ward (98), known for his wonder pill, most other commentators
believe him to be Dr. Richard Rock, who also made a reputation for a cure-all
known as the “famous, Anti-Venereal, Grand, <span class=SpellE>Specifick</span>
Pill.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This identification is supported
by a prescription signed by Rock, held in place by Moll’s teeth, compromised by
her mercury cure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rock is also pictured
setting up shop in “Morning.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other
physician is consistently identified as <a href="man2.htm">Dr. Jean <span
class=SpellE>Misaubin</span></a>, another pill doctor and the object of <span
class=SpellE>Fielding’s</span> scalding wit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He dedicated <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Mock Doctor</i>
to <span class=SpellE>Misaubin</span> and writes in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tom Jones</i> that the doctor was so confident of his reputation that
he “used <span class=GramE>to</span> say that the proper direction to him was
“To Dr. <span class=SpellE>Misaubin</span>, in the World.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> also uses <span

style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'> and Nichols comment that each of
the physicians is accusing the other of poisoning Moll (115); however it does
not appear that they are concerned with her at all. <span class=GramE>Neither
doctor even looks at his patient, and</span> their violent quarrel over the
effectiveness of their respective cures, <a href="table.htm">disrupts tables
and chairs</a>, continuing despite Moll's attendant who pleads with them to
either cease their dispute and honor the solemnity of the occasion or attempts
to attract their attention to the suffering patient. Their fine dress contrasts
with Moll's attire—a sheet used for sweating cures—and with her impoverished
surroundings which imply that much of Moll's money has been spent on her
ineffective cures. <span class=SpellE>Misaubin</span> literally has his back to
the patient, a pose that many of Moll's potential benefactors have adopted.
Most notably, is a <a href="../18/clergy.htm">parson</a> striking the same pose
in the initial plate of the series, setting the tone of neglect that will
follow Moll through her life. Her tragedy could have been prevented, or at
least lessened, if the clergyman had been less concerned with his letter,
likely soliciting a position from its addressee—the Bishop of London. He, like
the doctors of Plate 5, is more occupied with his own advancement than with the
obligations inherent in a life of service. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>,
then, indicts them all. An additional level of irony is that the one figure
consistently devoted to Moll is her <span class=SpellE>noseless</span>,
syphilitic <a href="woman2.htm">servant</a> who demonstrates more humanity than
those dedicated to its improvement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

plate also reveals that Moll has a <a href="son.htm">child</a> who will serve

</span>Despite being infested with vermin, he is healthy, having clearly never
missed a meal. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Moll’s motherhood is
ambiguously depicted; he is certainly well fed but is also clearly fending for
himself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unlike the <a

“agitated and disordered” but the disorder is very much confined to the room
(22).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also important is the lack of
artwork on the walls—<span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> often uses additional
works to magnify the symbolic import of his scenes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here the walls are almost bare, save a broken
mirror, which, rather than opening the plate to a more cosmic significance,
makes it a more individual fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    a slang name for the noose. Amid this turbulence and noise, the crashing and 
    shouting, the hissing water and raging fire Moll’s life is seeping from her. 
    She has no strength, no bite. She has been suffering the cure of ‘salivation’, 
    wrapped in blankets to make her sweat the disease away, dosed with mercury

faithful companion in the House of Correction, the abominable snub-nose who now
suddenly loses all hope of leading her lovely ward, had she only lived and
flourished longer to her own advantage, to the gallows. That is comfort indeed!
She has been carefully wrapped up in a sheet. Perhaps the nightgown which is
hanging on the line there to dry is her only one, and through the rapid change
made necessary by nature and art, is still out of action! With her right hand
the creature enjoins peace and silence upon the two respectable gentlemen
engaged in confidential discussion. <span class=GramE>Who these two men are we

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span>In
<st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> there has appeared for many
years now a weekly periodical which is turned out regularly, and always
contains articles of more uniform quality than any other weekly paper in the
world. It has never lacked contributors or contributions. Everything it
contains appears to have been dictated by Nature herself, although one knows
that it was often profound human skill which guided the pen. This is not to be
wondered at; it is even an observation apparent to anyone who understands human
nature. For since a certain happening in Paradise, about which we may read in
an old classical book that is not very much read nowadays, man has been so much
thrown upon the left side of his nature that it has been a proper study to
regain his right. Perfect order reigns on every page; everything has its
appointed place here, so that the lover of such things may immediately find his
way about. It is particularly strong in the touching, and the pathetic.
Passages which cause the reader's tears to flow, and others where his whole
being is shaken by shudders, are far from rare. These pages bear the heading:
'Weekly Bills of Mortality'. This little introduction was necessary before
informing my reader that the two gentlemen he sees there <span class=GramE>are</span>
a pair of learned men who at that time were specially engaged in procuring for
that journal the utmost completeness. They were, in every sense of the words,
for this weekly paper what the famous Addison and Steele were for another, to
wit the well known <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Spectator.</i> Without
them it could not have carried on with such completeness. So much is certain.
But on account of the great number of collaborators, each of whom had his friends
who wished to procure for him the distinction of being considered by <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> as deserving eternal remembrance, the names of
these honest men are not known for certain. This much is evident, that they are
a pair of <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Officiers</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> de <span class=SpellE>Sante</span></i>
(Medical Officers) as doctors are now called in the Paradise of Europe (Paris
of the Revolution), and, as we have reason to believe, have about the rank of
prison warders. For apart from these persons, and occasionally some respectable
experimentalist or elderly matron, nobody was allowed to supply contributions
to that weekly journal. Now according to a reliable tradition, the rather
corporeal gentleman with the convex belly is thought to be a <a href="man1.htm">German</a>,
the other more spiritual one with the concave belly a <a href="man2.htm">Frenchman</a>
named <span class=SpellE>Misaubin</span>. Of their manner of life, only a few
trivial items are known, and are hardly worth mentioning. The first, so it is
said, for some time played the clown with <span class=SpellE>Fargatsch</span>
of Hamburg; from there he fled to <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
to evade prosecution for having prepared a tooth-powder from human skulls; for
a while he <span class=SpellE>practised</span> there for dear life, and was
ultimately hanged. People say it was for murder. If so, it was probably not a
professional one, for it is well known that doctors in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
enjoy the privileges <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purgandi</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>, <span class=SpellE>saignandi</span> <span
class=GramE>et</span> <span class=SpellE>tuendi</span></i> as much as anywhere
else. Thus there remain only two <span class=SpellE>possibilitites</span>:
either he was hanged for his professional sins because he was not a proper
member of the profession, thus not a doctor proper but a mere <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lusus</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>naturae</span>;</i> or
he killed the person by a contrivance which was not a legitimate one. Ten or
eleven years ago a famous <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
doctor, Dr <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Gennis</span>,
almost ended on the gallows in that way (he was condemned to be hanged but was
later reprieved). He had done no more than bring his landlord to the
churchyard. They only came down on him so heavily because he had done it
without the agency of a mixture or powder, but merely with a <span
class=SpellE>breadknife</span> which he had sunk in the patient's body, and in this
way had by-passed, as it were, the apothecary. The other figure, Dr <span
class=SpellE>Misaubin</span>, was quite a good man, only he had rather too high
an opinion of a certain powder and certain pills which he compounded in his own
establishment; the latter being a sort of edible deer-shot. If death approached
one of his customers, very well—he loaded the patient with the pills as if with
grapeshot, and fired. In this way he skirmished and fought many a year with all
possible diseases. Official reports of his victories are not available, but
quite considerable loss of heavy and light cannon could regularly be traced in
the weekly journal. I have heard that out of malice (when is that ever absent
from merit?), they gave the honest man the nickname of Mice-<span class=SpellE>Aubin</span>.
This was because in later years, when another would perhaps have rested lazily
on his laurels, the good fellow tried his art on rats and mice. It is a bitter
and bread-depriving name, and that means quite a lot to a poor devil who even
without it had the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>embonpoint </i>of a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rat <span class=SpellE>d'eglise</span>.</i>
Highly unjust are such rat-like attacks upon the larders of one's fellow-men.
And had he really behaved so badly? He could no longer visit patients but still
had a good stock of his little powders; he therefore tried them out on whatever
came to his surgery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Oh! <span
class=GramE>this</span> is often the way of the world! How much good gunpowder
and shot intended for partridge and snipe are used up on the way home upon
sparrows and bats, whether out of boredom or to show one's skill, or because
nothing better is available. And after all, is the pursuit of vermin so very
far outside the scope of medicine? What then are lice, tape-worms and maw-worms
and the Greek <span class=SpellE>trichuriden</span>? Every occupation has its
gradations. I am therefore convinced that the ingenious author of Gil Bias, in
speaking of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exécution</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> de la haute <span class=SpellE>medecine</span>,</i>
had a distinction of this sort in mind, something like game-shooting and
rat-catching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE>So much for the history of these famous
men, and now for the use to which our artist has put it.</span> The girl has <span
class=GramE>fallen</span> a victim to them, and how else could such a duel have
ended? She fought against death and had none for Second but her own natural
constitution, <span class=GramE>good</span> in itself but often injured, weary,
and neglected at every opportunity. And yet, perhaps, being a young woman of
23, she might still have beaten her adversary. But He who knew this well had
chosen for himself a pair of Seconds, each of whom could have taken up the
fight alone against a dozen lives. That is why it went <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>veni</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>, <span class=SpellE>vidi</span>, <span class=SpellE>vici</span>,</i>
and suddenly there she lay. That this is the true explanation of the matter is
all too evident. For if the toad and the salamander who are quarrelling here
had not been Death's malicious Seconds, but had taken the side of Nature, they
would even now be striving to resuscitate the girl, whereas they are leaving
that to—the last Trump, and merely quarrel about who is to have the <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> of the deed. This mixture of mine in this glass,
says the toad, was the true oil on the fire; and my fire, shrieks the
salamander, had no need of your mixture. What a <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conflictus</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>pronominum</span>!</i> <span class=GramE>‘I’
against ‘I’ and 'you' against you'.</span> These are hard blows, especially
those of the ‘<span class=SpellE>I’s</span>. <span class=GramE>And how
beautifully they are demonstrated here, entirely in keeping with the laws of
impact.</span> The ‘I’ of the German has little velocity but all the more mass,
and consequently has impulse even when it seems to be at rest; the ‘I’ of the
Frenchman, on the other hand, has velocity but little mass, and therefore it
felt the need of support from tables and chairs and whatever else came in
handy. How gratifying for a German to observe how by the forceful thrust of his
countryman, the French mass, which had only been pieced together, falls apart
in all directions! <a href="table.htm">Chair and table</a> and plate and spoon
and ink bottle everything separates from the tiny kernel and collapses at the
impact of the other's quiet remark: &quot;this is my little mixture', while his
chair stands at rest, as it always has and always will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But there is still more to this group. It is of inexhaustible
significance. Would it be possible, one might ask, to depict a congress of
diseases, or what comes to the same thing, of quacks, more eloquently than here
with this <span class=SpellE>dropsical</span> individual and this hectic one? <span
class=GramE>The one inflated, heavy, phlegmatic and stolid, the other
concave-bellied, feverish, mobile and skinny?</span> How Dropsy squats there!
Medicine bottle and cane gripped as if they were the insignia of his
blood-brother—hour-glass and scythe; Hectic, on the other hand, having
surrendered scythe and hour-glass to his colleague, retains for himself the
skeleton shape and the deadly powder in the pill box, which proclaims better
than all the hour-glasses of his friend that the hour has struck—the rat
powder. The eyebrows of each reach up towards the adjacent hair, the wigs, with
a sort of longing which, they say, tends to signify inner conviction combined
with a touch of righteous anger over a failure to impress. Here, however,
especially with the <span class=SpellE>dropsical</span> subject, these hair
curves come rather too near to one another, nearer than with his hectic
companion, and this rather detracts from this interpretation. If I am not
mistaken, such an elevation of the brow signifies rather a consciousness of
uncertainty which tries to hide under the mask of caution. With Dropsy it seems
to have been brought on by mental conflict due to undigested reading; in the
more determined eye of Hectic we seem to read the effects of physical
indigestion. 'Oh dear, dear sister,' protests the former, 'do believe my word!'
'No! <span class=GramE>rubbish</span>, rubbish, absolute rubbish!' gasps the
latter. 'Here in this pill- box. . .' and from this explosion in front the
recoil is so strong, as with guns in general, that chair and table collapse.
This, as the reader will observe, is a second hypothesis to explain the
revolution in that room. We intentionally put it side by side with the other
which sought to explain everything by a blow from the German, and it will find <span
class=SpellE>favour</span> with those who believe that if only the German can
maintain his phlegmatic attitude long enough, his opponent from the volcanic
nation would burst of his own accord, or disperse into his constituent parts.
But by no means, dear reader, considering the limitations of our individual
vocabulary, and our lack of knowledge of the world, would we attempt to express
in words alone the constant and quietly operating forces, as well as the
erratic and turbulent ones, which were at work here, together with the
vociferous interference by snub-nose with her wormwood face, or to try to
represent completely in the form of an idyll what <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has so inimitably delineated with his stylus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The explosion has overturned the little <a href="table.htm">table</a>
and with it a spoon, a plate, an ink-bottle and pen, and a bulletin. The spoon

and touches the clean floor as little as possible, thus differing from bread
and butter, which always falls on the buttered side. But the plate! </p>

serious for a damaged one. From the visible fragments, at least, it would not
be possible to piece together a plate capable of containing anything which the <span

ink-bottle breaks and the earth receives in a wholesale way the black gall with
which it was filled, and which as an ingredient of prescriptions and
love-letters may perhaps have led many a poor devil to that very consummation.
It has finished its service. The collar round the neck of the pen, which has
saved it from ruin, protects it at least from further destruction, and even if
it were trodden upon in the turmoil, which however will not amount to much in
this comer, there is still another department where it could find employment.
Isn't it a splendid thing to have apart from one's writing end also a wiping
end? If as a writer you are no longer able to give instruction, <span

who has invested his spiritual and physical fortune in disastrous South Sea
shares of wealth and immortality through writing should let his dry pen teach
him every morning, before he dips it into the ink bottle to preach with it his
revelations to the world. The poster advertises a practical scheme concerning a
new method for curing all kinds of diseases by neckbands or necklaces. We can
see an illustration there of the necklace in question. At the top is the word <a
href="brokenchina.htm">'Anodyne'</a> written from right to left, and below from
left to right the word 'Necklaces', which even in the original is difficult to
read. The lines are meant to curve rather in the form of a neckband, for they
really make a circumscription, a sort of band around the neckband, and perform
here in reality for the project the service which the project itself merely
promises to the patient. Thus 'Anodyne Necklaces', necklaces which are to take
away pain A circle of words, half Greek and thus half mystical, drawn round an
entirely mystical amulet, could not fail of its purpose with a certain class of
person. It is really incredible, the success that device has achieved—I mean
the outer band around the inner one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
whether the inner one had benefited the patient himself has not, as far as we
know, become public knowledge, if we except the wall mentioned below. However,
that poster does not lie here simply as a satire upon the innumerable
advertisements for medicines which in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
are daily thrust unstamped into people's hands, and even into their pockets, by
some kind of postman; its meaning lies much deeper. This is one proof out of
many which we shall come across that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> in his
works, just as Nature in hers, knew how to achieve, often with one and the same
touch, more than one end, and knew also how to spread warmth where one might
have thought he only wanted to shine. <span class=GramE>For these anodyne
necklaces were originally intended by their inventor only for the use of
children suffering from the so-called English disease (the Rickets), about
which the unfounded prejudice prevailed in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE>England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE>
and in many parts of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class=GramE>Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE> that it is usually the fruit of tainted love.</span> This,
therefore, refers to the poor little <a href="son.htm">bastard</a> who near the
fireplace there half kneels and half sits beside the chair of his dying
mother,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>and who, untouched by that
dying and by the learned bellowing of the disputing gentlemen, and by the
screaming intervention of the woman who presides over all this, quite
peacefully roasts over the fire his pain- alleviating chop. Considering that he
may be suffering from rickets, he could from his size be about six years old;
deducting these six years from the mother's twenty-three, brings her age when
she was infected to seventeen. This is what <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
tells us by means of a slip of paper which lies there between the fragments of
a twice-broken plate and some pieces of furniture of rather equivocal form. If
the stout gentleman on the up- right chair there were to have been the inventor
of these pain-alleviating necklaces, as he could well have been, the satire
would acquire more branches still. For, as we remarked above, our learned
doctor himself died through an anodyne necklace, the rope (<span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>laqueus</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>anodymus</span></i>), which the law prescribed for
him, and which in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> works
wonders.</p>

text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Diagonally
opposite, in excellent contrast with the death scene, is a little scene of
acquisition. At least there is certainly a good deal of grasping going on
there. An old <a href="woman1.htm">woman,</a> perhaps formerly a sort of
chaperone to the girl, or else a relation of hers and of the smiling heir, or
what is most likely, her present landlady to whom something is probably owing
for rent and expenses, is now securing possession of the girl's little all, or
at least she is reckoning it up, for the sake other peace of mind. The death
rattle, the snorting and snarling of the doctors' fight, even the hissing of
the pot boiling over, do not distract her; she knows that people are mortal,
and that doctors will quarrel, and even that for the refilling of a pot which
has boiled itself dry, nothing in the world serves better than the
appropriation of a full trunk. A face like that is very necessary if in such a
den of murderers one is not to make mistakes in calculation; it is the very
image of deafness on principle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

woman is pulling out here and what corruption is appropriating over there in
the armchair which, as every man of feeling will recognize, rises far higher
than <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> genius usually aspired, but which,
notwithstanding, has been as adroitly executed as if it had been entirely
within his natural reach. Here lies first the dark <span class=GramE>negro</span>
mask with which the friendly, sunny, <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place> face had
darkened itself for a while at a Ball with artificial ugliness, so as to dazzle
by contrast a chosen few in a tête-à-tête with all the charm of bought <span
class=SpellE>favours</span>. The fan, since the fire of glances has ceased,
sleeps quietly in the embrasures, and perhaps mysteriously leads many an
imagination to attributes of the Tragic Muse, even through the mummery of love.
Next to it stand quietly the dancing shoes, whose form and movement and gold
and twinkling and glitter like so many will-o'-the-wisps, used once to throw
caution itself, the pedometer, into confusion, and lead on to where retreat was
no longer possible. Behind them lies the hat which we have seen before in the <a
href="../20/hp3small.htm">third Plate</a> hanging under the bed canopy, below
the comet. Ribbon and domino are unpacked too. Were we to cover the whole Plate
except for that comer, should we not think that an old chaperone was employed
in gathering together a costume for today's Masked Ball, for the little lamb in
her charge? But now remove the cover and cast a glance at the picture of misery
there in the armchair, the former owner of all that finery! Heavens above! Her
present domino, how limp, how pallid and how still compared with the rustling
silk which billows from the trunk. Her present mask alas! <span class=GramE>how</span>
pale, the make-up provided by the cold hand of death! And the dazzling light
other eyes, how deeply sunk into eternal night! They see not and are seen no
longer! There is no mummery here. Those eyes in the wan face have really been
pierced by the solemn arrow of death. With the black mask of luxury over there
it was a dagger fully congenial with those eyes, a closed fan, not dissimilar
in form as well as in use to the <span class=GramE>sword,</span> I mean the
rattle of—Harlequin. And where now are the little will-o'-the-wisp feet? Answer:
the lithe, hopping red-breast needed them for her living on the thorny
lust-hedges of <st1:Street><st1:address>Drury Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>;
the heavily draped Bird of Paradise there upon the arm- chair no longer wants
them. </p>

of the candidate for corruption to the <a href="../18/boxandbasket.htm"><span
class=SpellE>travelling</span> trunk,</a> so we could draw another between the
candidate for the gallows and another trunk that stands in the right
foreground. Of course, the latter is more a chair than a coffer, or just as
much (or rather more) a coffer to sit upon as a chair to shut something in. It
is partly covered, partly surrounded by all sorts of trivial articles of which
alas! <span class=GramE>shovel</span> and coal are by far the cleanest Oh we

up his mind to a rather disagreeable task, not entirely without persuasion and
not altogether of his own free will, nothing exculpates a possible human <i

text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Not to leave the
subject too abruptly, which is sometimes dangerous and would be specially so
here, we must first send a few remarks in advance, for one of which the reader
will be just as ready to let us off without proof as we shall be pleased to
give it for the other The first is that every freeborn human being, even one
who is not censor-free has a natural right to say what he likes about chairs of
all sorts, as long as he leaves in peace the people who <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
them with their behinds And the second, that there simply does not exist in the
world an utterly contemptible type of stool. The last sentence is especially
important for us In order to persuade people of it one need only bring the
matter near enough to the ancestor- and family-sense with which nature has
endowed everybody so conscientiously that almost as much enlightenment is
needed not to <span class=SpellE>honour</span> an otherwise unimportant man of
family as not to worship the sun. So here goes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In the whole realm of furniture which, to the best of my
knowledge has not yet found its Linnaeus, the class of chairs (classis <span
class=SpellE>sellarum</span>) is not only the most revered but also the most
extensive; it is a class which not only flourishes at all points of the
compass, but has discovered how to make itself indispensable. In a word, it is
among furniture what the class of mammals is among everything that lives and
feels. There are of course great differences between chair and chair, as
regards form and weight' just as with mammals, for instance between the whale
weighing more than many a house together with the inhabitants, and the Siberian
shrew whose weight rarely comes to 30 grains. But as all these animals have as
a common characteristic that they suckle their young, so all chairs have this m
common, that when in service they are presented with quite a respect- able part
of the body to support. To them belong, apart from ordinary<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>stools and chairs with and without backs, and
with and without arms, first all the thrones and all the cathedras from which,
as is well known, the world is governed, and which, run into one by skilful
carpenters, formerly represented what was called the Holy See. Next, all the
Judges' chairs, the heavy chairs of sorrow to which some of the foremost
thrones of the earth are said to belong, and the light <span class=SpellE>bergères</span>
(armchairs) to which again belong many a throne and many a cathedra. <span
class=GramE>After these comes the genus of benches, which are nothing but
systems of chairs.</span> Here belong the aristocratic and learned benches, all
slaughter houses, the so-called lazy bench and the eternal long bench—the whale
of the genus. These are followed by the Sedan chair and the Bath chair, the
ivory <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sella</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>curulis</span></i> of
ancient <st1:City><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:City>, as well as the
so-called chamber-chair between table and bed for those suffering from gout and
rheumatism. In conjunction with this comes the cabriolet; the English
storey-high phaeton whose name derives from 'turning over'; all <span
class=SpellE>flys</span>, all carriages, all <span class=SpellE>travelling</span>
and mail coaches from the German rib-<span class=SpellE>shatterer</span> to the
English cradle on springs and the majestic State carriage for which, instead of
making the gates wide and the doors high for it to pass through, they more
modestly took first the measure of the doors and gates. Immediately next to the
benches and opposite the Bath chairs comes the species of sliding chairs or the
so- called sledges in hundred-fold form; from the magnificent structure which
to the silver sound of a thousand bells overtakes even the wings of a winter
Zephyr, to the mourning-sledge which to the simple sound of the tolling bell
moves to the place of execution. Then come the riding saddles (also a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>genus <span class=SpellE>sellarum</span></i>),
the men's as well as the lesser known feminine side-saddle, which nowadays the
fleetest and proudest of all horses, Pegasus itself, no longer disdain. From
another side, and stretching far into the distance, we have the Inquisition
chairs of Holy Justice and the torture seats for the accouchement of
confessions, and the medical-surgical chairs for achieving more substantial
extractions. Of the latter type an extremely rare example is to be found in a
museum at <st1:City><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:City>, though I have
forgotten its name. After a considerable interval comes at last the <span

takes its name from the Goddess of the Night. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<span class=SpellE>une</span> <span class=SpellE>omelette</span>!</i> Could you
not have told us that at once?'—Impossible Madame. <span class=GramE>'Why not?</span>
I would merely have said: with all due respect.&quot; And so more or less
without any respect—No! <span class=GramE>what</span> can be said only 'with
due respect' must also be said respectfully, and that requirement we believe we
have now fulfilled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>After this if not diplomatic, at least diplomatically
circumstantial exposition of that seat's genealogical tree, and consequently of
the proof that it is in its right setting, we now expect from our gentle
readers a free passport for its companions. These comprise a small tin vessel
with a handle and, immediately behind, a rather equivocal bowl, and on the
ground a no less equivocal earthenware pan covered with a tin lid. The little
vessel is clearly a Dutch spittoon (<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Quispedorje</i></span>) and in more than one respect fits rather well
into the suite. It is standing on <span class=GramE>an advertise</span>- <span
class=SpellE>ment</span> of the immortal Dr Rock. Can those be pills which are
lying on it? Pills which lie between the name of Dr Rock and a spittoon are
mercury pills all right. <span class=GramE>But the pipe?</span> Perhaps it lies
there only to mask the spitting, just as brandy drinkers of some standing and
principle are said to drink brandy out of tea-cups to spare the feelings of
their weaker brethren. Or is there perhaps such a thing as mercury-tobacco? Or
was the last <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> lover perhaps a sailor from the
land of cleanliness? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We have called the bowl up above and the pan down below
equivocal; this they are in a very high degree. How if the first turned out to
be a butter or dripping bowl and the other a frying pan which has just been
lifted off the fire with a wet rag? That would be some evidence of orderliness,
and also of precaution, namely that these chaperones had made some provision
for themselves on such a day. In any case, somebody's goose is being cooked
here. Perhaps death appeared suddenly after a happy expectation of complete
recovery and they began too soon to think of feasting, for which pots and pans
and bottle are as indispensable in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as drum and trumpet with us. On such occasions one offers thanks to Heaven,
without forgetting oneself in the process. Everybody according to his
customs—that is as it should be. But there may be another interpretation, which
almost seems to be the right one, and that is precisely what makes that corner
so—dangerous. What, one might ask, if the object which stands there behind the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quispedorj</i>e</span> were
something of the same type, only bigger, for instance an <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>archi-quispedorje</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>?</i> And the pan down there a mere
satellite of the worthy stool The assumption is somewhat strong but, according
to our feeling, so much in <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> spirit that we
cannot possibly withhold it from our readers, especially as we have made such a
profound apology. Besides, it is only the suite which is under discussion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We mentioned above a line of comparison which might be
drawn from the gallows-bird Quack and his consort to the corner under
suspicion. The reasons for the comparison are these. Everything has been done
to save the patient, but in vain. But in the hour of death both doctors hit
upon an idea which might have saved her, had they thought of it sooner, and
that is the medicines which they hold in their hands. Of course, each counts
the other's medicine among those which could never be given too late. Both
bottle and box, with the new medicines, are still unopened, and therefore the
patient died. But where are the old medicines with their consequences? They lie
partly in the armchair beside the fireplace, and then—in the corner under
suspicion. In a word, that corner contains in various forms, the products into
which those medicines were transformed. One grasped what was nearest to hand
and sought for help first here, then there, and as speed was necessary, the
vessels had temporarily to be deprived of their function in the kitchen and
were transferred to the department where the stool presides. Thus afterwards
one knew at least obiter where one was. On the pan lies a plate on which we can
distinctly read the word 'Cook'. Evidently it belonged to the <span
class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> chop-house. We shall not disturb it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>To that corner also belongs the bladder of well-known
form, which has found a nail to hang from above the <span class=SpellE>mantlepiece</span>
between a couple of medicine bottles and a broken jar. This is the best
position for display in the whole room. If I am not mistaken, <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> wanted to intimate through the intentional elevation
of that instrument and by bringing into prominence the allied vessels that the
doctors had specially adopted the vomit and <span class=SpellE>lavage</span>
method. With this I would agree. If however his intention was to mock, he was
very much in the wrong. Does he not know that this method is almost the only
one whose efficiency, so to speak, could be demonstrated geometrically and even
elegantly? That the girl has died of it, what difference does that make? Good
Heavens! <span class=GramE>what</span> could one not die of? Did not the
postman <span class=SpellE>Jablkowsky</span> of Warsaw in January 1792 die from
300 oysters? Since that demonstration, which is really due to Dr Swift, a
well-known physician for sick souls and sick governments, has not become
general knowledge as far as we know, we shall give it here translated into our
somewhat learned book language, whereas Swift expresses it so that a child
could understand it, and that would not do. Since diseases, as everyone knows,
are said to be nothing but reversions of the natural processes of some
functions in the body, it is not even thinkable that they should be reversed
again, that is brought back into the right direction, so long as the old
disorderly habits of life continue which brought about the first reversal.
This, it seems to us, is so clear that the proof requires nothing for
completeness but a reference in brackets to a preceding paragraph, which
however everybody will here find in his own head. But since, furthermore, all
who fall ill have, up to the moment when this happens, eaten or ingested <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in <span class=SpellE>dubio</span></i> with
their mouth, which we shall call A, and have effected the emission with the
opposite end B, it is impossible that, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rebus
sic <span class=SpellE>manentibus</span>,</i> the disorder should be halted and
their health again restored. <span class=GramE>Again as clear as daylight.</span>
What then is to be done? The problem answers itself: one must start to eat with
the end B, and transfer the emission to the end A, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>id <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>est</span></span>,</i> to give <span
class=SpellE>lavage</span> and to vomit. Nature hesitates, bethinks herself,
turns round, and in this way everything ends as desired. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Now finally let us glance at the furniture in the room
itself. The mirror seems to have been discarded since the truth which it told
began to be somewhat troublesome, and to have been relegated to the corner next
to the fireplace, which is not very accessible and by no means the spot in that
rather composite room where one would choose to disrobe and admire oneself, at
least it is no place for an Os <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sublime.</i>
It hangs, of course, next to the fireplace, if one starts from the chimney; if
one starts elsewhere, it hangs differently, etc. On the mantelpiece, where the
household gods usually find their place, there stand here, too, the present <span
class=SpellE>Penates</span> of that happy family, together with some
sacrificial bowls dedicated to the past ones. Those are merely symbolical, the
three <span class=SpellE>Parcae</span> in the form of three medicine bottles
with their necklaces, and then the Ibis with its famous beak in the shape of a
bladder. Here should have stood the super domestic god, the mirror which never
smiles more graciously on its priestesses than when the fire on his altar
through their chaste cheeks and eyes full of devotion is sending up to him
light and glow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Above the throne of
these goddesses floats a canopy of damp, perhaps still dripping, washing which
stretches over the seat of the dying and by its influence transforms that
apparently warm place into a veritable <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sub
<span class=SpellE>Dio</span>.</i> <span class=GramE>The time and place of the
drying, as well as the number of pieces which are to dry, testify to deep
poverty.</span> How wretched are the house- holds where these three points are
among the family secrets. <span class=GramE>Where the shirt on the washing line
has to pretend to the chaste invisibility which it rightly preserved on the
body.</span> There luxury at least is out of the question. The whole change of
service is then usually a change of one with one, or one with none. The last
object on the line on the right hand side seems to be something padded, which
is only hanging there for the purpose of being aired; one cannot tell quite
what it is nor how it keeps its balance; but in the original it is drawn more
as if it covered a similar piece as its counterweight. Probably it served
itself for the purpose of padding, and would then be an impostor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Opposite the chimney-piece, high up on a nail beside the
door, hangs a round disc, perforated or indented, whose meaning Nichols, in his
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>,</i>
has correctly interpreted. It is a Jewish Easter cake, <span class=SpellE>Mazzos</span>
as they are sometimes called, which English Jews (as in some parts of Germany)
send to their customers, more as a symbol of a substitute than as a real
substitute, and which therefore they tolerantly treat not as victuals but as
hardly more than an emblem of food. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the righteous of the fourth social class make fly-traps out of them, evidently
by covering them with some sticky substance or, at least, with something which
would for some time keep the dried mucilage in suspension. Nichols has
repeatedly seen them used like that by people of that class. Whether it was <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> intention to point merely at the class habits of
the person occupying that room, whose whole Christianity had been reduced to
that noble remnant of a cheap contempt for Jewry, or whether, as seems more
likely to me, the cake at the same time represents a remnant of the past <span
class=SpellE>splendour</span> of the second Plate, we gladly leave to the
reader's judgment. In any case, the little moon was sure to reflect much light
on to the sick- bed and, as Hesperus, would shine powerfully into the dying
woman's conscience, which in the eventide of life is said to be very receptive
to such reflections. At the Bell Inn she was betrayed, and that was a
misfortune! <span class=GramE>In the Portuguese temple towards which that star
is pointing, she betrayed and sinned on her own account, and that was a crime.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>That in this room there must have been
better and happier times than now, happier too than in the House of Correction,
of that we find in controvertible evidence on the ceiling. Almost over the bed
we read the well-known 'M.H.' written with a brand, the initials which we saw
upon the trunk outside the <st1:place>Inn</st1:place> in the first Plate. That trunk
is seen here again only somewhat aged. Such inscriptions, executed by some <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bel</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> esprit</i> <span class=GramE>who</span> had
to climb on table and chairs, are seldom made without a good amount of high
spirits But this is not all. Behind this 'M.H.' stands another word which <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has almost blotted out again, and thereby
contributed not a little to its lasting memory. We shall not, of course,
restore it but merely remark for the benefit of lovers of unreadable
inscriptions that the Latin translation of it can be found in the third Satire
of the first Book of Horace How salubrious and airy this little room must be,
especially for a somewhat be-quacked patient, strikes the eye immediately. On
one side the whitewash has peeled off-the wall, and on the other the wood-work
is partly rotten. On the left side, under the <a href="sticks.htm">two tallow
candles</a>, it looks almost as if the wall had been patched up with a foreign
substance. The door it appears, owes its rigidity not to the usual firm frame
into which the panels are fitted, but to a single cross-beam upon which the
boards are nailed. The doors of pigsties usually have three such beams, either
parallel or in the shape of a Z. This structure is also the source of
considerable loop-holes for healthy air and comforting looks, and these have
been patched and pasted over with much consideration for elegance. Considering
moreover, the tender childlike sympathy with which the boy follows the fate of
his mother, the silent despair with which the old woman seems that all is lost,
throws herself upon her knees, the dull, albeit gentle look with which the
female minister to souls is still seeking, but hardly expecting, help from the
compassionate doctors—then Molly's fate becomes almost enviable, at least for
some people; it seems to me as if I heard their: </p>
