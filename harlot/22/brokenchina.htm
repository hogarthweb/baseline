    and, with reversed &quot;Ns,&quot; &quot;ANODYNE [Necklace]&quot; and a pictured 
    necklace, refers to a much-advertised panacea of the time. 'Hogarth has ironically 
    combined the two uses of anodyne necklaces (which were advertised in newspapers 
    daily during these years, with the little design on the necklace and a child's 
    head): as cures for the pains and complications of teething and for venereal 
    disease. A typical advertisement (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Craftsman,</i> 
    Dec. 2, 1732) claims curative power &quot;for Children's Teeth, Fits, Fevers, 
    Convulsions, &amp;c. and the great Specifick Remedy for the Secret Disease.&quot; 
    Rock too had a much-advertised toothache cure (&quot;without drawing&quot;) 
    as well as his &quot;famous, anti-venereal, grand, specifick pill,&quot; and 
    they were often advertised in parallel columns. Thus the teeth lying on the 
    paper refer to both the little boy and Moll. The necklace can suggest that 
    (as Marjorie Bowen believes, p. 139) Moll &quot;has at least had that one 
    tender thought for her child,&quot; that she is simply trying another cure 
    for her own disease, or, as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="../../marriage/marriage6/mmm6small.htm">Marriage à la Mode,<span
style='font-style:normal'> Pl. 6</span></a></i>, that she may be treating signs

    ran for decades in nearly every newspaper, derived from a shop at the Sign 
    of the Anodyne Necklace, against Devereux Court outside Temple Bar, where 
    two distinct remedies were sold: the necklace for teething children and for 
    venereal disease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus the presence 
    of the necklace could refer to the son or the mother or both.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Judging only by the venereal disease ads, a 
    reader might well conclude that the disease rate had appreciably increased 
    and was parallel to those degeneracies Pope chronicled in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

is a sad thing for a whole plate, but not quite so serious for a damaged one.
From the visible fragments, at least, it would not be possible to piece
together a plate capable of containing anything which the neighbouring paper
poster could not hold equally well. The ink-bottle breaks and the earth
receives in a wholesale way the black gall with which it was filled, and which
as an ingredient of prescriptions and love-letters may perhaps have led many a
poor devil to that very consummation. It has finished its service. The collar
round the neck of the pen, which has saved it from ruin, protects it at least
from further destruction, and even if it were trodden upon in the turmoil,
which however will not amount to much in this comer, there is still another
department where it could find employment. Isn't it a splendid thing to have
apart from one's writing end also a wiping end? If as a writer you are no
longer able to give instruction, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stilum
vertas!</i> and you can still sweep. A moral which every budding author who has
invested his spiritual and physical fortune in disastrous South Sea shares of
wealth and immortality through writing should let his dry pen teach him every
morning, before he dips it into the ink bottle to preach with it his
revelations to the world. The poster advertises a practical scheme concerning a
new method for curing all kinds of diseases by neckbands or necklaces. We can
see an illustration there of the necklace in question. At the top is the word
'Anodyne' written from right to left, and below from left to right the word 'Necklaces',
which even in the original is difficult to read. The lines are meant to curve
rather in the form of a neckband, for they really make a circumscription, a
sort of band around the neckband, and perform here in reality for the project
the service which the project itself merely promises to the patient. Thus
'Anodyne Necklaces', necklaces which are to take away pain A circle of words,
half Greek and thus half mystical, drawn round an entirely mystical amulet,
could not fail of its purpose with a certain class of person. It is really
incredible, the success that device has achieved&#8212;I mean the outer band
around the inner one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For whether the
inner one had benefited the patient himself has not, as far as we know, become
public knowledge, if we except the wall mentioned below. However, that poster
does not lie here simply as a satire upon the innumerable advertisements for
medicines which in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> are daily
thrust unstamped into people's hands, and even into their pockets, by some kind
of postman; its meaning lies much deeper. This is one proof out of many which
we shall come across that Hogarth in his works, just as Nature in hers, knew
how to achieve, often with one and the same touch, more than one end, and knew
also how to spread warmth where one might have thought he only wanted to shine.
For these anodyne necklaces were originally intended by their inventor only for
the use of children suffering from the so-called English disease (the Rickets),
about which the unfounded prejudice prevailed in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in many parts of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that it is usually the fruit of tainted love. This, therefore, refers to the
poor little <a href="son.htm">bastard</a> who near the fireplace there half
kneels and half sits beside the chair of his dying mother,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>and who, untouched by that dying and by the
learned bellowing of the disputing gentlemen, and by the screaming intervention
of the woman who presides over all this, quite peacefully roasts over the fire
his pain- alleviating chop. Considering that he may be suffering from rickets,
he could from his size be about six years old; deducting these six years from
the mother's twenty-three, brings her age when she was infected to seventeen.
This is what Hogarth tells us by means of a slip of paper which lies there
between the fragments of a twice-broken plate and some pieces of furniture of
rather equivocal form. If the stout gentleman on the up- right chair there were
to have been the inventor of these pain-alleviating necklaces, as he could well
have been, the satire would acquire more branches still. For, as we remarked
above, our learned doctor himself died through an anodyne necklace, the rope (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>laqueus anodymus</i>), which the law
prescribed for him, and which in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
works wonders (57-59).</p>
