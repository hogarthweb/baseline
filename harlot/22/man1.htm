the physicians is accusing the other of poisoning Moll (115); however it does not
appear that they are concerned with her at all. Neither doctor even looks at
his patient, and their violent quarrel over the effectiveness of their
respective cures, <a href="table.htm">disrupts tables and chairs</a>,
continuing despite Moll's attendant who pleads with them to either cease their
dispute and honor the solemnity of the occasion or attempts to attract their
attention to the suffering patient. Their fine dress contrasts with Moll's
attire&#8212;a sheet used for sweating cures&#8212;and with her impoverished
surroundings which imply that much of Moll's money has been spent on her
ineffective cures. Misaubin literally has his back to the patient, a pose that
many of Moll's potential benefactors have adopted. Most notably, is a <a
href="../18/clergy.htm">parson</a> striking the same pose in the initial plate
of the series, setting the tone of neglect that will follow Moll through her
life. Her tragedy could have been prevented, or at least lessened, if the
clergyman had been less concerned with his letter, likely soliciting a position
from its addressee&#8212;the Bishop of London. He, like the doctors of Plate 5,
is more occupied with his own advancement than with the obligations inherent in
a life of service. Hogarth, then, indicts them all. An additional level of
irony is that the one figure consistently devoted to Moll is her noseless,
syphilitic <a href="woman2.htm">servant</a> who demonstrates more humanity than
those dedicated to its improvement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    </b>In <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> there has appeared 
    for many years now a weekly periodical which is turned out regularly, and 
    always contains articles of more uniform quality than any other weekly paper 
    in the world. It has never lacked contributors or contributions. Everything 
    it contains appears to have been dictated by Nature herself, although one 
    knows that it was often profound human skill which guided the pen. This is 
    not to be wondered at; it is even an observation apparent to anyone who understands 
    human nature. For since a certain happening in Paradise, about which we may 
    read in an old classical book that is not very much read nowadays, man has 
    been so much thrown upon the left side of his nature that it has been a proper 
    study to regain his right. Perfect order reigns on every page; everything 
    has its appointed place here, so that the lover of such things may immediately 
    find his way about. It is particularly strong in the touching, and the pathetic. 
    Passages which cause the reader's tears to flow, and others where his whole 
    being is shaken by shudders, are far from rare. These pages bear the heading: 
    'Weekly Bills of Mortality'. This little introduction was necessary before 
    informing my reader that the two gentlemen he sees there are a pair of learned 
    men who at that time were specially engaged in procuring for that journal 
    the utmost completeness. They were, in every sense of the words, for this 
    weekly paper what the famous Addison and Steele were for another, to wit the 
    well known <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Spectator.</i> Without them 
    it could not have carried on with such completeness. So much is certain. But 
    on account of the great number of collaborators, each of whom had his friends 
    who wished to procure for him the distinction of being considered by Hogarth 
    as deserving eternal remembrance, the names of these honest men are not known 
    for certain. This much is evident, that they are a pair of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Officiers de Sante</i> (Medical Officers) as 
    doctors are now called in the Paradise of Europe (Paris of the Revolution), 
    and, as we have reason to believe, have about the rank of prison warders. 
    For apart from these persons, and occasionally some respectable experimentalist 
    or elderly matron, nobody was allowed to supply contributions to that weekly 
    journal. Now according to a reliable tradition, the rather corporeal gentleman 
    with the convex belly is thought to be a German, the other more spiritual 
    one with the concave belly a <a href="man2.htm">Frenchman</a> named Misaubin. 
    Of their manner of life, only a few trivial items are known, and are hardly 
    worth mentioning. The first, so it is said, for some time played the clown 
    with Fargatsch of Hamburg; from there he fled to <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> 
    to evade prosecution for having prepared a tooth-powder from human skulls; 
    for a while he practised there for dear life, and was ultimately hanged. People 
    say it was for murder. If so, it was probably not a professional one, for 
    it is well known that doctors in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    enjoy the privileges <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purgandi, saignandi 
    et tuendi</i> as much as anywhere else. Thus there remain only two possibilitites: 
    either he was hanged for his professional sins because he was not a proper 
    member of the profession, thus not a doctor proper but a mere <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lusus naturae;</i> or he killed the person 
    by a contrivance which was not a legitimate one. Ten or eleven years ago a 
    famous <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> doctor, Dr Mr Gennis, 
    almost ended on the gallows in that way (he was condemned to be hanged but 
    was later reprieved). He had done no more than bring his landlord to the churchyard. 
    They only came down on him so heavily because he had done it without the agency 
    of a mixture or powder, but merely with a breadknife which he had sunk in 
    the patient's body, and in this way had by-passed, as it were, the apothecary. 
    The other figure, Dr Misaubin, was quite a good man, only he had rather too 
    high an opinion of a certain powder and certain pills which he compounded 
    in his own establishment; the latter being a sort of edible deer-shot. If 
    death approached one of his customers, very well&#8212;he loaded the patient 
    with the pills as if with grapeshot, and fired. In this way he skirmished 
    and fought many a year with all possible diseases. Official reports of his 
    victories are not available, but quite considerable loss of heavy and light 
    cannon could regularly be traced in the weekly journal. I have heard that 
    out of malice (when is that ever absent from merit?), they gave the honest 
    man the nickname of Mice-Aubin. This was because in later years, when another 
    would perhaps have rested lazily on his laurels, the good fellow tried his 
    art on rats and mice. It is a bitter and bread-depriving name, and that means 
    quite a lot to a poor devil who even without it had the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    Highly unjust are such rat-like attacks upon the larders of one's fellow-men. 
    And had he really behaved so badly? He could no longer visit patients but 
    still had a good stock of his little powders; he therefore tried them out 
    on whatever came to his surgery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Oh! 
    this is often the way of the world! How much good gunpowder and shot intended 
    for partridge and snipe are used up on the way home upon sparrows and bats, 
    whether out of boredom or to show one's skill, or because nothing better is 
    available. And after all, is the pursuit of vermin so very far outside the 
    scope of medicine? What then are lice, tape-worms and maw-worms and the Greek 
    trichuriden? Every occupation has its gradations. I am therefore convinced 
    that the ingenious author of Gil Bias, in speaking of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exécution 
    de la haute medecine,</i> had a distinction of this sort in mind, something 
    like game-shooting and rat-catching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>So much for the history of these famous men, and now for
the use to which our artist has put it. The girl has fallen a victim to them,
and how else could such a duel have ended? She fought against death and had
none for Second but her own natural constitution, good in itself but often
injured, weary, and neglected at every opportunity. And yet, perhaps, being a
young woman of 23, she might still have beaten her adversary. But He who knew
this well had chosen for himself a pair of Seconds, each of whom could have
taken up the fight alone against a dozen lives. That is why it went <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>veni, vidi, vici,</i> and suddenly there she
lay. That this is the true explanation of the matter is all too evident. For if
the toad and the salamander who are quarrelling here had not been Death's
malicious Seconds, but had taken the side of Nature, they would even now be
striving to resuscitate the girl, whereas they are leaving that to&#8212;the
last Trump, and merely quarrel about who is to have the honour of the deed.
This mixture of mine in this glass, says the toad, was the true oil on the
fire; and my fire, shrieks the salamander, had no need of your mixture. What a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conflictus pronominum!</i> &#8216;I&#8217;
against &#8216;I&#8217; and 'you' against you'. These are hard blows,
especially those of the &#8216;I&#8217;s. And how beautifully they are demonstrated
here, entirely in keeping with the laws of impact. The &#8216;I&#8217; of the
German has little velocity but all the more mass, and consequently has impulse
even when it seems to be at rest; the &#8216;I&#8217; of the Frenchman, on the
other hand, has velocity but little mass, and therefore it felt the need of
support from tables and chairs and whatever else came in handy. How gratifying
for a German to observe how by the forceful thrust of his countryman, the
French mass, which had only been pieced together, falls apart in all
directions! <a href="table.htm">Chair and table</a> and plate and spoon and ink
bottle everything separates from the tiny kernel and collapses at the impact of
the other's quiet remark: &quot;this is my little mixture', while his chair
stands at rest, as it always has and always will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But there is still more to this group. It is of
inexhaustible significance. Would it be possible, one might ask, to depict a
congress of diseases, or what comes to the same thing, of quacks, more
eloquently than here with this dropsical individual and this hectic one? The
one inflated, heavy, phlegmatic and stolid, the other concave-bellied,
feverish, mobile and skinny? How Dropsy squats there! Medicine bottle and cane
gripped as if they were the insignia of his blood-brother&#8212;hour-glass and
scythe; Hectic, on the other hand, having surrendered scythe and hour-glass to
his colleague, retains for himself the skeleton shape and the deadly powder in
the pill box, which proclaims better than all the hour-glasses of his friend that
the hour has struck&#8212;the rat powder. The eyebrows of each reach up towards
the adjacent hair, the wigs, with a sort of longing which, they say, tends to
signify inner conviction combined with a touch of righteous anger over a
failure to impress. Here, however, especially with the dropsical subject, these
hair curves come rather too near to one another, nearer than with his hectic
companion, and this rather detracts from this interpretation. If I am not
mistaken, such an elevation of the brow signifies rather a consciousness of
uncertainty which tries to hide under the mask of caution. With Dropsy it seems
to have been brought on by mental conflict due to undigested reading; in the
more determined eye of Hectic we seem to read the effects of physical indigestion.
'Oh dear, dear sister,' protests the former, 'do believe my word!' 'No!
rubbish, rubbish, absolute rubbish!' gasps the latter. 'Here in this pill- box.
. .' and from this explosion in front the recoil is so strong, as with guns in
general, that chair and table collapse. This, as the reader will observe, is a
second hypothesis to explain the revolution in that room. We intentionally put
it side by side with the other which sought to explain everything by a blow
from the German, and it will find favour with those who believe that if only
the German can maintain his phlegmatic attitude long enough, his opponent from
the volcanic nation would burst of his own accord, or disperse into his
constituent parts. But by no means, dear reader, considering the limitations of
our individual vocabulary, and our lack of knowledge of the world, would we
attempt to express in words alone the constant and quietly operating forces, as
well as the erratic and turbulent ones, which were at work here, together with
the vociferous interference by snub-nose with her wormwood face, or to try to
represent completely in the form of an idyll what Hogarth has so inimitably
delineated with his stylus (53-57).</p>
