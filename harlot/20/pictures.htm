    an honour to have become the Curtius to that Macedonian of the heath.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At his death a monument was erected in his honour, 
    but curiously enough without a pedestal. Its support came from above, evidently 
    because his M stood in front of his name. Moreover he did not hang there in 
    marble or bronze, but in order to save the expense of a sculptor or iron-founder, 
    and also to obtain the greatest possible likeness, the man was used in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>persona.</i> 
    Never have I wished for more space than here. There is so much to say. But 
    only a brief outline can be given. We have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statuas 
    pedestres</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equestres,</i> just 
    as we have foot-pads and highwaymen. But it seems to me that in the classification 
    of statues in this world, an important type has been left out, which neither 
    Greece nor Rome has reckoned with, and which seems to have been left to our 
    time; that is, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Statua pensilis.</i> 
    A small <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contradictio in adjecto</i> 
    between standing and hanging will, I hope, be disregarded by the critic; it 
    is only a grammatical contradiction, and in the usual run of our statues we 
    have more occasion to swallow contradictions that go much deeper. I cannot 
    see why people who have, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cum grano salts,</i> 
    served the human race should not be suspended in bronze and by chains of bronze, 
    with a hymn book in hand, and even on a gallows of bronze in the backyard 
    of the Pantheon for instance. Should perhaps the secret foundries of Meudon 
    go in for that sort of thing? They could always work in advance. For it would 
    be an easy matter for French wit and French artistry to create a monument 
    with movable limbs so that it could be erected in the wind month (Ventose), 
    and in the heat month (Fervidor) hang suspended in the backyard of the Pantheon. 
  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next the M'Heath hangs another man with S.T.P. after his
name, meaning Sanctae Theologiae Professor, Dr Sacheverel. It is a very good
thing for an interpreter of these Plates that the name Sacheverel undoes ten
times over what the letters S.T.P. may for a short time have bestowed on him.
He disported himself upon the highway to Heaven just like his counterpart on
the road from <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> to <st1:City><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>.
Hogarth deserves praise for stringing him up like that. The trial of that
fanatic has been compared in some German newspapers recently to that of the
cobbler Hardy. To whose credit I hardly know. The uproar which accompanied the
trials had, of course, some similarity. Equality of that sort is easy to
establish in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>. Tumult in the
depths is there always the effect of movement from above, whatever the movement
may be. Dr Sacheverel and Hardy both caused a commotion, but, it seems to me,
with the important difference that people considered that caused by the Doctor
as too high, and that by the cobbler as perhaps too low. Dr Sacheverel was one
of the Watchers of Zion of whom Lessing has said that whenever they see some-
thing glimmer in the dark they immediately cry 'fire!' without first making
sure whether it might not be only a little streak of the Northern Lights. But,
strictly speaking, the Doctor lit his pipe in a place and at a time when he
ought not to have done so. He proceeded so incautiously that, in the end, <st1:City><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:City>
and the City very nearly suffered the damage which the Doctor had been paid to
prevent. Sacheverel was an extremely Tory- minded preacher at a time (1709)
when the Government, as is well known, was Whig. But it seemed to him, and that
was his little pipe, as if all dissenters were not only tolerated, but
favoured. After some strong pulls at the pipe in the dark, and being perhaps a
little giddy or otherwise not quite himself, he fancied he smelt the flame
licking towards <st1:City><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:City> and shouted
for help. He preached, not in a small chapel, but in Saint Paul's Cathedral
itself, on the words of the Apostle about the danger of false brethren;
attacked the Ministry and its laws, not even in allegories but with outspoken
words in the most violent manner; referred in the pulpit to the then Lord
Chancellor under the name of Volpone, and commanded the people to put on the
armour and the sword of God, and to rise against the false brethren. The day
chosen by that true brother for his sermon was the 5th of November. As is well
known, this is the anniversary not only of the Gunpowder Plot, but also of the
famous landing which brought about the Bloodless Revolution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It is also known how on that day the protestant heresy of
the <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> crowd, having rested
quietly on the yeast the whole year through, starts to ferment, just like some
wines when the vine begins to blossom anew. In the name of the Gospel, sacred
fires are kindled in the streets, and the Pope is burned in effigy as a warning
to false brethren. Sacheverel's sermon had the effect that not only window
frames, shop windows, cellar doors, booths and similar inflammable material
were brought to feed the fire, but also the church pews of the false brethren,
and almost the false brethren themselves. Wasn't that terrible? But surely,
some reader will perhaps join me in asking, there must have been a fire hose
near at hand to direct upon the mouth, from which that glowing sulphur was
issuing, an arm-thick jet of water, and consecrate the head with a baptism of
water? Perhaps the people at the sight of such a contest of the elements might
have put on the garment of mirth and the mien of mockery and the whole matter would
have been extinguished. But alas! it did not end like that. The Lord Mayor at
that time, probably also a sulphur-saint, had the righteous one's sermon
printed, and now there was fire everywhere; it was extolled to Heaven by his
followers. The wiser heads in Parliament advised against making the matter more
important than it really was by drawing attention to it, but in vain.
Sacheverel was arraigned before the Bar of the House of Lords as a major
law-breaker. That was just what he wanted. Things grew worse and worse; his
carriage was escorted daily by a huge crowd of jubilant people on its way from
Westminster Hall to Temple Bar. The houses of the dissentient commu- nity were
looted, chapels hitherto tolerated were pulled down, and even the houses of the
Lord Chancellor Lord Wharton, and the Bishop of Sarum, were threatened with
destruction. And what was the final outcome of all this tumult? Sacheverel was
found guilty of a misdemeanour, which means anything between a crime deserving
capital punishment, and nothing at all, and on which English Courts make no
definite pronouncement. Had the Doctor stolen a seal he would have been hanged.
As it was, however, he was suspended from preaching for three whole years, and
his Opus was publicly burned. Was it all over now? Far from it. The affair
spread higher and higher, farther and farther, and, one must admit, from now on
with good reason. The trivial punishment was regarded as the equivalent of a
discharge, just a face-saving device, and the culprit, while still alive, was
regarded thenceforth as a saint and a martyr at the same time. In his honour <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
blazed at night from one end to the other with sacrificial fires and
sacrificial illuminations. Now the martyr began to enjoy his position with a
vengeance. He drove in triumph through the land. The <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Oxford</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> came to greet him with
pomp and a ceremonial procession, and they caroused all day long for the sake
of the Gospel. A large part of the English aristocracy entertained him with
magnificence and pious debauchery, and the municipal magistrates came to meet
him with music, mounted soldiery and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
pontificalibus.</i> The bushes by the wayside where he passed were decorated
with garlands, while pennants and flags fluttered from the steeples, and the
whole air rever- berated with 'Sacheverel and the Church'. That is how things
stood then. Posterity, we see, has revised the case and quashed the sentence,
and Hogarth who, when it came to the execution of sinners whose neck was too
strong for ordinary justice, possessed an inimitable strength, has here hanged
the saint next to MacHeath. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sic pagina
jungit amicos.</i> And the MacHeaths and the <st1:City><st1:place>Daltons</st1:place></st1:City>
are indeed said to have played a major part in Sacheverel's transfiguration.
While he sowed his spiritual blessing, they carried the necessary agricultural
tools with which to till the ground in a temporal way, if need be, should it
prove too stubborn to receive it (32-35). </p>
