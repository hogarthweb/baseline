III is the last plate where <a href="moll.htm">Moll</a> is overtly sexual.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been seen by commentators as the
beginning of the harlot’s swift decline.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shesgreen notes that Moll has been “discarded by the merchant,” rendered
less marketable and is “forced to live in a slum in </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Drury Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>” (20).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although Moll’s standard of living has
declined, and she is on the verge of imprisonment and ruin, signs of her power
are still abundant in the scene.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is
literally “on top” of her lover who lurks beneath the bed. (The <a
href="cat.htm">cat</a> betrays his presence.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He is a highwayman, a type she prefers (obvious from the picture of <a
href="pictures.htm">Macheath</a> on her wall), and if she does not assist her
lover in his crime, she benefits from his haul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Much has
been made of the <a href="hatandtwigs.htm">witch’s hat and broom</a> over
Moll’s bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shesgreen notes that her low
station has caused her to resort to <span class=GramE>serving</span> “sexual
deviants” and to practicing “black magic” (20).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sex in Georgian England</i>, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

uncommon in the brothels of the period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If the birch twigs are for this purpose, Moll is interestingly dominant
in these sadomasochistic affairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again,
she retains control, maintaining her status as sexual aggressor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The
possibilities of witchcraft are fascinating as well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>George Lynman Kittredge notes the English
definition of a witch:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In
considering the tenacity of the popular belief . . <span class=GramE>.the</span>
essence of witchcraft is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maleficium.</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hatred and terror which a witch evokes is
due to her will and power to inflict bodily injury. . . . She is hunted down
like a wolf because she is an enemy of mankind. (<span class=GramE>qtd</span>.
in Erickson 17).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Thus,
the hat and broom become symbols of power, of a dark sexuality which is able to
escape the patriarchal definitions of womanhood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll, as witch and whore, is no longer
woman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robert Erickson cites <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Whores Rhetorick</i> which delineates this
reasoning, stating, “I must tell you a Whore is a Whore, but a Whore is not a
Woman; as being obliged to relinquish all those frailties that render the Sex
weak and contemptible” (35).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This early
text recognizes the connection between weaknesses and traditional definitions
of womanhood, and also demonstrates that, to become powerful, women must
transcend that womanhood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll, before
her apprehension and death, does this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She creates herself, choosing her lovers for sex or money and
maintaining the sexual upperhand in her relationships.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her power is a threat to English order; her
tendency toward dark magic eludes the imperative for Christianity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This rejection of conventional religion is
also realized in her picture of <a href="pictures.htm">Dr. Sacheverel</a>, a
religious dissenter and her use of the <a href="table.htm">Pastoral Letter</a>
for wrapping butter. Moll certainly cannot continue in this powerful state, and
so, as victim still to Hogarth’s text, must die in despair and utter ruin.</span></p>

    </span>The letters were satirized by many in those years as another sign of 
    “Dr. Codex’s” pomposity and self-esteem; but Hogarth evidently intends also 
    to parallel the clergyman who does not help the Harlot in her moment of need 
    and the Bishop (whom the clergyman is soliciting), who, spending his time 
    writing about Deists, gives his flock as little help (vol. 1 253).</p>

    of contrast I take to be the Harlot’s “air”—the inappropriateness of her dress,

    up appearances, though she had some somewhat down in the world, and there

    the medicine bottles on the sill, and the magistrate Gonson softly entering

    is a print of the angel staying the hand of Abraham about to sacrifice his

    not with Isaac but with Abraham.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And 
    the print is also, of course, an address to the audience, whose response is 
    different from the Harlot’s and perhaps parallel to the screaming admonitory 
    choric face made by the knot in the Harlot’s bed curtain: mercy, we tend to 
    read, is better than rigorous Old Testament justice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My point is that once an object is interpreted 
    in different ways by different characters, those characters have moved from 
    the function of mere “others” (or objects) to subjects in their own right, 
    with the capability of symbolizing their own “others.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>Defoe characters see the world outside as threat or providence, but

other pictures, we left the description of the furnishings to the end. They
were of secondary importance. It was the human figures who explained the
significance of the furniture. Here it is the furniture which has to illuminate
the human beings. A young female body, not without charms, is soon adorned.
What does not grace it will be graced by it, and what may be lacking here or
there in person or attire will not be noticed by young people of the opposite
sex, or it can easily be made good by something of which another part has been
deprived, and which it is perfectly willing to do without <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in majoram gloriam</i> of the whole. In this way such a creature can go
far, always patching up the visible garment at the expense of the invisible,
and the decay in beauty at the expense of honesty, until the whole, patched and
repatched for the last time, attains its resurrection after a brief death, and
what decayed as Hackabout rises again as Mother Needham. But for the lodging
and its furniture, patching up is not so easy in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
where money is so cheap and, consequently, everything else so terribly
expensive; nor is it so necessary. For when someone goes out into the street
from a room like that, he will no longer remember what it looked like, and the
eyes coming in from the street will certainly have some degree of blindness and
intoxication. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The scene is <st1:Street><st1:address>Drury Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>,
as we can tell from the Pewter jar which stands on the ground in the right-hand
comer. The little room must be rather high up, for to see so much sky through
the door as we see here would be possible in <st1:Street><st1:address>Drury
  Lane</st1:address></st1:Street> only in the vicinity of the chimney stacks.
This is also indicated by the windows opposite where no light enters even
through the sections where the glass is <span class=GramE>missing,</span> and
where they have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ad interim</i> replaced
the glass by mere air. The light comes mainly from the side from which we are
looking and Hogarth leaves it to our architectonic intuition to imagine the
hole through which it might come. What a transformation! Here, too, tea is
being drunk, but in what style? Were it not for the cups and the teapot, one
would almost expect to see shoes being repaired here! The silver table with its
delicate legs is gone, and in its place is another with a pair of legs that
could support an ox. Evidently the service it is now performing is not the only
one it has to do. To judge from its strong and somewhat thick-set shape, it
seems likely that it is sometimes used for pounding meat on, or even as a stand
for the washtub, or for tired guests who cannot find accommodation elsewhere.
The same little foot and the same knee which overturned the silver table are
again in evidence, but no longer for the purpose of upsetting the table; on the
contrary the foot seems to find support on its structure. The silver teapot,
too, has gone, yielding place to a miserable tin affair, just as the
long-tailed monkey has been replaced by a <a href="cat.htm">long-tailed cat</a>
and the <a href="maid.htm">chamber-maid</a> and <span class=GramE>negro</span>
by a hybrid creature who is a cross between a chamber-maid, a negress and a
long-tailed monkey. On the little table we see only one cup and saucer, and an
odd cup, probably containing sugar, a small loaf of bread, a knife and a little
butter for which a literary production has provided the plate. For the sheet of
paper on which it lies is part of the <a href="table.htm">Pastoral Letter</a>
of Bishop Gibson, Bishop of London, which that honest man had with the best
intentions despatched to his parishioners. It is said that despite the address
clearly written on them, they did not reach their destination until the grocers
co-operated and undertook the delivery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Beside the bed stands a miserable cane chair, the only one
in the room however, if the little table has to serve for breakfast or washing.
The chair now in its turn is serving as a sort of table and carries a bottle
which has been elevated to the rank of a candlestick, and a soup plate which
last night was so far degraded that from now on it could only serve with honour
under the bed. Over the chairback she has thrown her last night's <a
href="jacket.htm">jacket</a>, probably of red material with imitation gold
trimmings, which would look splendid especially by the light of a street lamp
of the fourth magnitude, inducing curiosity and fancies. When a garment like
that is on show, Londoners of all ranks will be caught in the snare like larks
in reflected sunlight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

the toilet table, also on elephant rather than goat legs. It is really a
gate-legged table which, like everything else in this room, performs multiple <span
class=GramE>service</span>. Against a punch bowl with an indenture which is
newer than the bowl leans a triangular fragment of a mirror, which is newer
than the whole. Neither the cut-out nor the cut-off portions are the work of
art, but of chance. In front of the mirror there lies here too an ivory weapon!
<span class=GramE>for</span> waging war against bites from outside; against
those from inside from which people might sometimes suffer here, there stands
the armoury next to the mirror—a little brandy glass and a brandy measure. The
former, we observe, has also by chance suffered a terrible amputation whereby
it is forced to stand upon its head when empty, and to let itself be held up
when full. It is usually just the opposite with the men whom it serves and who
do homage to it. The other objects standing there are apparently cosmetic
paraphernalia intended to transform, for a little while, into deceptive wax
fruit the face decayed too soon, which in Yorkshire would no doubt have
remained a sound and natural fruit. A little note, to 'Md. Hackabout', peeps
out of the drawer, evidently a little love sigh which vents itself in writing. </p>

 o'clock</st1:time> according to the fashionable time they keep here. Our
heroine has roused herself and is supporting herself somewhat wearily and
heavily upon her right arm; in her left hand she dangles a watch at the end of
a ribbon, her head in a listening attitude. Evidently the watch is a repeater
and is striking the hour. <span class=GramE>The hour?</span> Alas! <span
class=GramE>it</span> is nothing but a meaningless 'eleven'. What help are all
the repeater watches in the world to you? A pair of repeater ears through which
the warning of your honest father would again resound in your soul would be of
infinitely more value. But listen —the hour has struck! Much is lost, but not
yet everything. Justice is awake and holds back the final stroke which already
hovers over your head. The door opens and <a href="men.htm">Sir John Gonson</a>
with his retinue enters the room and our heroine is arrested. Evidently the
watch is a small item of booty from last night, and the loser has perhaps complained
to the authorities. The charming creature whose upper half appears to be
supported by a rag-heap of petticoats is evidently the president of the
establishment. Her nose seems to have suffered, whether in an affair of the
heart through internal inflammation, or in an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

not know. At this point we must ask our readers to shed a few tears on behalf
of a poor devil who has given them much pleasure, but who now is no longer: the
gay, droll, latinizing Partridge in Fielding's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

half of that martyr was the very spit of this turbot! But let us avert our eyes

thou didst ever find apt since thou didst not understand it: </p>

proceed to the remaining ornaments on the Plate, which will now be better
understood. At the head of the bed, or rather of the recess under which the bed
frame stands, there hovers between canopy and earth a comet with a terrific
tail—the broom of education—the birch. We have been rather slow to mention it
although among all the inanimate objects on the Plate this is usually the
first, after the watch, that is, to attract the eye of the spectator. We have
called it terrible, but merely in accordance with linguistic custom; for these
comets on the firmament of morals do just as little harm to that system as
those in the sky to the system of the physical world. Just as Newton has
assumed that the latter might perhaps with their tails fan an invigorating
atmosphere into the system, so it might not only be supposed but could be geometrically
demonstrated that the former actually sweep a great deal of evil out of the
world with theirs. If, however, we see them not as <a href="hatandtwigs.htm">birches</a>
but merely as bundles of faggots, then their use is really limitless; one might
well ask, for example, what would become of the rushing stream of instruction
and learning which in school pours through both our ears, if they were not in
due course to build a dam at the other end out of such faggots to prevent its
escaping there helter-skelter. But how does the pedagogic faggot or rod of
philanthropy come to be here, and just on the head-board of the bed? The
problem, I must admit, is really not an easy one. I wish it were even more
difficult, or so difficult that it simply could not be solved. Oh! <span
class=GramE>that</span> sort of problem makes the most wonderful material for
authors who are paid by the page, like bricklayers by the cubic foot. But alas!
<span class=GramE>the</span> problem is not an easy one, and that is just what
makes it so difficult. However, we will try. <span class=GramE>A small
introduction to start with.</span> For the first time in the work of our artist
we are here at a point to which we shall often have to return, and twice in
this series of pictures alone. It is namely the point where morals themselves
prohibit moralizing, and the most eloquent interpretation grows dumb or at
least pretends to be dumb and makes only signs to the passer-by, or if it is
ultimately compelled to speak, will say nothing more than 'I am dumb&quot;. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Philosophers have observed long ago that blindness is partial
death, and indeed Nature seems to subscribe to that opinion, which is not
always so with the remarks of philosophers. But I doubt whether against any
evil in this vale of misery there are more remedies than against the inability
to see. If the sun will not come out, all right, we can put the light on. That
is only a small thing. If cataract shuts the window, again no harm; the
ophthalmic surgeon will open it again. If a man becomes myopic, and sees no
more of the Universe than the tip of his own nose, or if he becomes a
Presbyterian (or should I say presbytopic?) and sees the church steeple clearly
but not his neighbour who stands before him, the whole matter can be put right
with twelve shillings paid to the optician. With the help of that great Triple
Alliance, candle-maker, ophthalmic surgeon, and spectacle maker, man has
successfully fought absolute as well as relative blindness, defensively at
least, so that its encroachment which may still take place here and there is
hardly noticeable. Indeed, we have even taken the offensive, and there is hope
one day of seeing the mote in a brother's eye as far away as the moon. Is it
not queer with vision? Have we not already a sort of telegraphy with the moon
so that by exact calculation we can find out, in one and a half seconds, when a

there were a telegraph for the remaining five senses, too! But with these it is
rather a sad story! There the Presbyterian grows more and more myopic; long
sight becomes short sight, and soon ends in complete blindness. Oh, that
someone could kindle a light in that quarter or operate for cataract or make a
pair of spectacles! Oh! <span class=GramE>that</span> would be the alchemist's
stone, I mean of old age, without which no wisdom is possible. It has been
tried a thousand times, but with what success? But we were speaking I believe
of the educational birch at the bed-head. Is this then a pair of spectacles—for
Presbyterians? To tell the truth, I am not quite sure myself; I only know this,
that if it is such a thing, it will not be worn on the nose. I think I have
done my duty now, in having commented on a ticklish passage in my author at
such length that I do not understand myself any more, and that is all an honest
commentator can do. What, however, this locus lacks in clarification, we
promise our readers to make good tenfold in other places where it might not be
half so necessary, and this again is all an honest commentator can do. </p>

there, <span class=GramE>lies</span> the <a href="box.htm">wig-box</a> of a
notorious street robber, James Dalton. If it is not already a legacy, it will
surely become one soon since the fellow was hanged about that time. How low our
heroine has fallen! Street robbers are criminals of the third rank, altogether
without professional honour. In a nation of highwaymen, who count their
ancestors right back to Alexander, they would just be hanged. To his honour and
the girl's we will assume that he was no sly pickpocket but that he robbed
honestly and took risks, heart against heart, or at least pistol or knife
against cudgel; but still only as a foot-pad and not on horseback. The horse
elevates and ennobles even rogues—in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It has been said that the robber who sticks to the ground is something of a
Yahoo, while the one on horseback is always a bit of a Houyhnhnm. It is no
trifle that <st1:City><st1:place>Dalton</st1:place></st1:City> has entrusted
there to the girl. Wigs of every condition, form and hue are important items in
a robber's inventory. He might change his appearance, like the hares and
partridges of some regions, who in summertime look like ploughed land or
stubble fields, and in winter like snow. Or if he has plundered in one wig as a
caterpillar, he may change through another into a chrysalis, and in a third he
may evade the arm of justice as a butterfly. It is on record that some rascals
before being brought to their Examination and Promotion <span class=GramE>have</span>
in the course of eight days made the round of all Four Faculties with their
wigs. In the end, of course, these masks of the back of the head become
witnesses against the head itself, and this renders the pawn on the canopy here

evidently because his M stood in front of his name. Moreover he did not hang
there in marble or bronze, but in order to save the expense of a sculptor or
iron-founder, and also to obtain the greatest possible likeness, the man was
used in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>persona.</i> Never have I wished
for more space than here. There is so much to say. But only a brief outline can
be given. We have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statuas pedestres</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equestres,</i> just as we have foot-pads
and highwaymen. But it seems to me that in the classification of statues in
this world, an important type has been left out, which neither Greece nor Rome
has reckoned with, and which seems to have been left to our time; that is, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Statua pensilis.</i> A small <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contradictio in adjecto</i> between standing
and hanging will, I hope, be disregarded by the critic; it is only a
grammatical contradiction, and in the usual run of our statues we have more <span
class=GramE>occasion</span> to swallow contradictions that go much deeper. I
cannot see why people who have, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cum grano
salts,</i> served the human race should not be suspended in bronze and by
chains of bronze, with a hymn book in hand, and even on a gallows of bronze in
the backyard of the Pantheon for instance. Should perhaps the secret foundries
of Meudon go in for that sort of thing? They could always work in advance. For
it would be an easy matter for French wit and French artistry to create a
monument with movable limbs so that it could be erected in the wind month
(Ventose), and in the heat month (Fervidor) hang suspended in the backyard of
the Pantheon. </p>

text-autospace:none'>Next the M'Heath hangs another man with <a
href="pictures.htm">S.T.P.</a> after his name, meaning Sanctae Theologiae
Professor, Dr Sacheverel. It is a very good thing for an interpreter of these
Plates that the name Sacheverel undoes ten times over what the letters S.T.P.
may for a short time have bestowed on him. He disported himself upon the
highway to Heaven just like his counterpart on the road from <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
to <st1:City><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:City>. Hogarth deserves praise
for stringing him up like that. The trial of that fanatic has been compared in
some German newspapers recently to that of the cobbler Hardy. To whose credit I
hardly know. The uproar which accompanied the trials had, of course, some
similarity. Equality of that sort is easy to establish in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>.
Tumult in the depths is there always the effect of movement from above,
whatever the movement may be. Dr Sacheverel and Hardy both caused a commotion,
but, it seems to me, with the important difference that people considered that
caused by the Doctor as too high, and that by the cobbler as perhaps too low.
Dr Sacheverel was one of the Watchers of Zion of whom Lessing has said that
whenever they see some- thing glimmer in the dark they immediately cry 'fire!'
without first making sure whether it might not be only a little streak of the
Northern Lights. But, strictly speaking, the Doctor lit his pipe in a place and
at a time when he ought not to have done so. He <span class=GramE>proceeded</span>
so incautiously that, in the end, <st1:City><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:City>
and the City very nearly suffered the damage which the Doctor had been paid to
prevent. Sacheverel was an extremely Tory- minded preacher at a time (1709)
when the Government, as is well known, was Whig. But it seemed to him, and that
was his little pipe, as if all dissenters were not only tolerated, but
favoured. After some strong pulls at the pipe in the dark, and being perhaps a
little giddy or otherwise not quite himself, he fancied he smelt the flame
licking towards <st1:City><st1:place>Zion</st1:place></st1:City> and shouted
for help. He preached, not in a small chapel, but in Saint Paul's Cathedral
itself, on the words of the Apostle about the danger of false brethren;
attacked the Ministry and its laws, not even in allegories but with outspoken
words in the most violent manner; referred in the pulpit to the then Lord
Chancellor under the name of Volpone, and commanded the people to put on the
armour and the sword of God, and to rise against the false brethren. The day
chosen by that true brother for his sermon was the 5th of November. As is well
known, this is the anniversary not only of the Gunpowder Plot, but also of the
famous landing which brought about the Bloodless Revolution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>It is also known how on that day the protestant heresy of
the <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City> crowd, having rested
quietly on the yeast the whole year through, starts to ferment, just like some
wines when the vine begins to blossom anew. In the name of the Gospel, sacred
fires are kindled in the streets, and the Pope is burned in effigy as a warning
to false brethren. Sacheverel's sermon had the effect that not only window
frames, shop windows, cellar doors, booths and similar inflammable material
were brought to feed the fire, but also the church pews of the false brethren,
and almost the false brethren themselves. Wasn't that terrible? But surely,
some reader will perhaps join me in asking, there must have been a fire hose
near at hand to direct upon the mouth, from which that glowing sulphur was
issuing, an arm-thick jet of water, and consecrate the head with a baptism of
water? Perhaps the people at the sight of such a contest of the elements might
have put on the garment of mirth and the mien of mockery and the whole matter
would have been extinguished. But alas! <span class=GramE>it</span> did not end
like that. The Lord Mayor at that time, probably also a sulphur-saint, had the
righteous one's sermon printed, and now there was fire everywhere; it was
extolled to Heaven by his followers. The wiser heads in Parliament advised
against making the matter more important than it really was by drawing
attention to it, but in vain. Sacheverel was arraigned before the Bar of the
House of Lords as a major law-breaker. That was just what he wanted. Things
grew worse and worse; his carriage was escorted daily by a huge crowd of
jubilant people on its way from Westminster Hall to Temple Bar. The houses of
the dissentient commu- nity were looted, chapels hitherto tolerated were pulled
down, and even the houses of the Lord Chancellor Lord Wharton, and the Bishop
of Sarum, were threatened with destruction. And what was the final outcome of
all this tumult? Sacheverel was found guilty of a misdemeanour, which means
anything between a crime deserving capital punishment, and nothing at all, and
on which English Courts make no definite pronouncement. Had the Doctor stolen a
seal he would have been hanged. As it was, however, he was suspended from
preaching for three whole years, and his Opus was publicly burned. Was it all
over now? <span class=GramE>Far from it.</span> The affair spread higher and
higher, farther and farther, and, one must admit, from now on with good reason.
The trivial punishment was regarded as the equivalent of a discharge, just a
face-saving device, and the culprit, while still alive, was regarded
thenceforth as a saint and a martyr at the same time. In his honour <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
blazed at night from one end to the other with sacrificial fires and
sacrificial illuminations. Now the martyr began to enjoy his position with a
vengeance. He drove in triumph through the land. The <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Oxford</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> came to greet him with
pomp and a ceremonial procession, and they caroused all day long for the sake
of the Gospel. A large part of the English aristocracy entertained him with
magnificence and pious debauchery, and the municipal magistrates came to meet
him with music, mounted soldiery and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
pontificalibus.</i> The bushes by the wayside where he passed were decorated
with garlands, while pennants and flags fluttered from the steeples, and the
whole air rever- berated with 'Sacheverel and the Church'. That is how things
stood then. Posterity, we see, has revised the case and quashed the sentence,
and Hogarth who, when it came to the execution of sinners whose neck was too
strong for ordinary justice, possessed an inimitable strength, has here hanged
the saint next to MacHeath. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sic pagina
jungit amicos.</i> And the MacHeaths and the <st1:City><st1:place>Daltons</st1:place></st1:City>
are indeed said to have played a major part in Sacheverel's transfiguration.
While he sowed his spiritual blessing, they carried the necessary agricultural
tools with which to till the ground in a temporal way, if need be, should it
prove too stubborn to receive it. </p>

text-autospace:none'>There are two more pictures hanging on the same wall. <span
class=GramE>Immediately below MacHeath a little half-length portrait with a
halo and, above the uneven windows, Isaac's sacrifice.</span> The interpreters,
if they mention the first at all, simply say it is the Virgin Mary. This is,
however, to say the least, a very poor idea of theirs. For one thing, the
figure is obviously of the male sex, and that puts an end to their
interpretation. But even if it were not so, the idea in itself is somewhat
repellent to a certain sentiment which Hogarth, despite his roguery, never
offends as far as I know. Nor would it be a good sign in him. Of course, here
or there in the Christian world the image of that holy figure may be hung in
some private temple wherein God is served as badly as in this one. But such an
explanation is much too far-fetched, and one's immediate revulsion would blunt
all feeling for the feeble attraction of such a commonplace joke. In a word, it
is not true. The thing is surely a Calendar Saint. Think only of their number,
365. In that considerable flock, should there not have been a single mangy
specimen like Sacheverel or MacHeath? About Isaac's sacrifice the interpreters
either say nothing at <span class=GramE>all,</span> or something which is just about
as valuable. This is the interpreter's way with tricky passages. Apparently the
picture is a relic from the Portuguese establishment and what we said earlier
quite ingenuously contains perhaps the best explanation. It is really there
that the girl's history takes a turn which, for one in her position, could
still be called fortunate. The sword that was raised above her is halted, and
the place where Isaac was to be sacrificed merely signified: the Lord sees.
What more? Hogarth evidently did not see very deeply here, and thought merely
of salvation from violent death, or of withholding a blow from the sword of
strict justice in special cases through the intervention of a higher grace
endowed with the power to do this. That is how thousands who see nothing deeper
in it understand the story of Isaac. Had Hogarth been also a philologist and a
divine, the explanation would of course have been forced. But is this not often
true of Bible interpretations by people who are everything that Hogarth was
not? How much more readily then should we not forgive in a Christian way a man
from whose character a little light-hearted frivolousness cannot be completely
explained away. </p>

Rats and mice rarely go begging from well-to-do people, and in this, I think,
they are not far wrong. But the cat's posture is not that of an animal
stealthily stalking with intent to pounce. So we shall leave that where it is,
too. On the back curtain of the bed there still hangs a winged head-gear from
the previous evening, having evidently escaped there in haste during the
attack, so that the pleats should not be crumpled. The hat seems to have escaped
before that and while the parties were still upright. <span class=GramE>Now a
few words about the knot in the bed curtain.</span> Mr <st1:country-region><st1:place>Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sees a face in it, and even a resemblance to the Mother Superior, the Turbot. I
have so little against this hypothesis that I even find that Mr Ireland has
seldom seen with such Hogarthian eyes as here. It certainly is not out of
keeping with Hogarth's character as poet and artist to give the knot in a
curtain around the altar of Venus Pandemos the form of a miserable face which,
with averted eyes, weeps for the sacrifices which are offered up there. The
knot appears to be tied with care and certainly not without meaning; apparently
to admit the necessary light and also allow free falling space for the comet
when it approaches the sun. Whether in addition the face resembles that of the
High Priestess, the Turbot, we shall not decide, but we cannot help winding up
at this juncture with an incidental observation about the golden rule: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ne quid nimis.</i> It is true we have to
deal here with a very whimsical and original humorist, but this should not make
us ruin our own healthy eyesight, nor should we believe we see things in the
picture which in fact only exist this side of the tip of our own noses. This is
reminiscent of our modern prophetesses who with the point of a needle trace out
Mamselle's for- tune from the coffee grounds in her cup, and hold forth
something like this: 'Do you see, my charming young lady, the little circle
here; it is as clear as can be, it is a carriage wheel; and these little dots
here, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, those are the footsteps of—wait a moment my dear
child— yes, that's right, of six horses. Oh, would you breathe on it once more?
Now, do you see? That's clearly a star. Count the points yourself. So my dear
young lady, a carriage and six, and a star as well, and now this here, ah! <span
class=GramE>what</span> could that be!' ... but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ne quid nimis.</i> This, however, is not an attack upon the small
sallies of wit, be they true or assumed, which a commentator allows himself,
obviously at his own expense. These are the stamped property of the
commentator, which we may or may not accept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What concerns me here is only the deeply sensed meaning of the whole.
The meaning of the whole Hogarth has never concealed; he could have done so
only to his own disadvantage. His general aim is apparent at the first glance,
and this is essential. Without it, a work of art of this kind cannot succeed.
Once, however, that meaning is established, the desire to elucidate small
subordinate obscurities will increase the pleasure of the onlooker, which would
be completely destroyed by obscurity in the whole. We should throw the picture
away. Thus the picture of the Strolling Actresses is simply a representation of
the disorder and ridiculous contrasts which must necessarily arise when
strolling actresses are dressing in a small room; to make the contrast still
more striking, he chooses an opera about the gods, in which, in the theatre,
Diana hunts the stag, and behind the scenes, the stag often chases Diana. To
present that disorder as a whole in a single picture was the richest possible
subject for the talent of our artist. Here his genius was at home. Had he been
compelled to have his wings clipped in accordance with some conventional rule
or particular theme, he certainly would not have risen from the earth. This,
for instance, very likely happened to him in the Hudibras pictures.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whoever, therefore, looks for a plan in that
Plate and a particular mythological play, certainly does not know Hogarth's
genius too well. It would, of course, have been more in accordance with the
Proclamation of Aesthetics if he had, despite all his self-assurance and
confidence in his inner strength, subordinated himself to the contract which
crude barbarity must necessarily conclude with refined humanity if it wishes to
sell its wares in our philosophical markets. But that he could not do; he could
only produce the shape, we others might do the finer work. To give just one
example: this very picture of the Actresses has been interpreted, confidently
and with an air of superiority, as representing the love affair between Diana
and Endymion. One of my friends has countered that ridiculous explanation not
only with the attitude but with the confidence of true superiority, by an
interpretation of the same picture which I should have liked to relate here in
full. He has explained it by reference to the French Revolution, and with a
wittiness which is immensely superior to that other trivial invention. I can
only briefly outline it here. But I, as well as my friend, are compelled to
suppress some of the strongest touches because of feelings of a higher kind
which persuade us that a joke like that, expressed in public, could easily be
misunderstood, since it concerns persons who have a right to our compassion,
the more so the less we know today what our own fate may be tomorrow. Thus the
two devils at the altar with the bass viol and the head of the Medusa, which
turns everything around it to stone, are, it seems to me, self-evident—<span

trade is excellently expressed by the waves which have been thrown into a
corner. Cats are turning the globe without knowing what they are doing!
Bishops' mitres become receptacles for comedy texts Jewels made of leaves fill
a maltster's hamper. This could be nothing else but assignats for jewellery,
and that tremendous wealth is threatened with destruction by a burning tallow
candle. There is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sans-culotterie</i>
everywhere here; even the one pair of trousers lies abandoned. A furious cat has
its tail cut off; does that not mean Robespierre's tail? The threshing flail,
symbolizing agriculture, lies in the corner. The empty trunks are as clear as
can be. A sea-goddess from the <st1:place>West Indies</st1:place> presents a <i

rum, and both of them are crying <span class=GramE>She</span> herself is thrown
up on dry land. The monkey who plays his tricks with the helmet, possibly of
Pallas, cannot be misunderstood. Also the search for garments in the clouds has
its meaning. So it goes on through the whole picture, and the assembly in which
all this takes place is entitled: </p>
