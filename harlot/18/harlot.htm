month="1" day="4" year="1711">Jan. 4, 1711/12</st1:date>), where he mentioned 
    seeing the &quot;most artful Procuress in the Town, examining a most beautiful 
    Country-Girl, who had come up in the same <span class=SpellE>Waggon</span> 
    with my Things.&quot; The scene is the yard of the Bell Inn, where coaches 
    from the country stopped; there was an inn of this name in <st1:street><st1:address>Wood 
    Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Cheap- side. The girl wears the dress of 
    a country girl, a kerchief and a full- blown rose hiding her bosom; a pincushion 
    and a pair of scissors hang at her waist. The wagon has &quot;B.R.&quot; and

    and its intrigues&#8212;and also suggesting that the girl cannot afford a 
    stagecoach. Stephens (BM Sat.) detected &quot;with much simplicity of expression 
    . . . , a voluptuous character in her features, and a certain frivolity.&quot; 
    Her name, we learn in Pls. 3 and 6, is M[<span class=SpellE>ary</span>?] <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> 
    (initials &quot;M.H.&quot; are on her portmanteau). The goose she carries

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>,</i>&quot; bears a striking resemblance to 
    her, and implies her own fate, as she listens to Mother Needham's blandishments. 
    The meaning of her name is clear enough: hack is a carriage for hire, and 
    about implies street-walking. There was, however, a prostitute of this name 
    (her Christian name, Kate) who appears in a list of women taken into custody 
    for disorderly conduct (Grub-street Journal, Aug. 6, 1730): &quot;the famous 
    Kate <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> (whose brother was lately <span
class=SpellE>hang'd</span> at <span class=SpellE>Tyburn</span>) a woman noted 
    in and about the Hundreds of Drury, for being a very termagant, and a terror, 
    not only to the civil part of the <span class=SpellE>neighbourhood</span>, 
    by her frequent fighting, noise, and swearing in the streets in the night-time, 
    but also to other women of her own profession, who presume to pay or pick 
    up men in her district, which is half one side of the way in Bridges-street.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

    her licentiousness and debauchery (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The 
    Grub Street Journal</i> for August 6, 1730, giving an account of several prostitutes 
    who were taken up,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>informs us that 
    &#8220;the fourth was Kate <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span>&#8212;whose 
    brother was lately hanged at <span class=SpellE>Tyburn</span>&#8212;a woman 
    noted in and about the hundreds of Drury, etc.) (104-106).</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The heroine of the piece is the daughter of 
    a poor village <a href="clergy.htm">parson</a> from <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>. 
    We see both father and daughter in the first Plate. The girl, standing in 
    the foreground, has just got down from the wretched <a href="wagon.htm">cart</a> 
    which, as appears from its superscription, has brought her from the country; 
    the father in the background is not so much riding as merely straddling his 
    horse. How the girl stands there! Of course she is not a great beauty&#8212;one 
    can see that. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> was no painter of beauty; 
    as far as I know, only two people in his whole life have claimed this for 
    him: one was <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> himself and the other his good 
    wife. But what the girl lacks in refinement is more than compensated by good 
    health, childish simplicity, and gentle innocence. Her manner is that of a 
    sturdy, clean, well-behaved village girl, who could be made into something&#8212;and 
    that is just what happens. Her figure seems to have developed somewhat on 
    the broad side, in the rough service of Ceres and <st1:City><st1:place>Pomona</st1:place></st1:City>. 
    Had she been gathering forget-me-nots, daisies, violets and all the rest of 
    the sentimental love-posies, she would perhaps have been cast in a finer mould. 
    However, she is still in her middle teens, and still growing, and doubtless 
    much of the angularity in her appearance must be put to the account of the 
    village tailor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>In her
attire, so simple and countrified, like her whole person, there is not a trace
of falsehood; nothing is built up too high or spread too wide.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hat, corsage, and neckerchief guard and
protect what has been entrusted to them faithfully, without bragging, and with
the least possible display, like honeycombs. There are no unoccupied <span
class=SpellE>storeys</span> in the former, and in the latter no empty
galleries. Her face which reposes under the former speaks for itself in
eloquent silence, is understandable to all and open to all, and needs no
interpretation; to what is beneath the latter, on the other hand, where only
conjectures are permitted, Flora has given an almost superfluous security by fixing
a little rose there: innocence with the bloom of youth. From here the
fortification proceeds downwards in the usual manner with three-or four-fold
wall right to the little feet, standing very general in parallel. If the
commander is not susceptible to bribery, then, as far as that quarter is
concerned, the campaign looks promising. At her side hangs a needle-case and a
little pair of scissors, and from her right arm a small bundle: they were
probably put there by the poor weeping mother when she said goodbye, for
occupation and refreshment on the journey(4-5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none'>Our heroine, the good,
honest, village girl from <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>, thus alights at the
Bell Inn in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>. The healthy,
country flower is transplanted from its native soil into this boundless garden
amidst fertilizers and insects in a thousand forms, unknown in <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>;
unfortunately, she just chances to light on one of the most infamous
flower-beds for miles around. Before she has time to strike root, an insect (I
mean here Her Ladyship with the dainty watch) fastens in its sting, which is to
ruin her straight growth for ever, at least upon this earth. The explanation is
as follows:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
