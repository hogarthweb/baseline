    in London&#8221;).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Short-sighted and 
    insensitive to the crises around him (including his own), like his horse,

    Gibson of London, Walpole&#8217;s adviser on church patronage (alluded to 
    in the third plate).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And just as he

    </b>Hogarth told the French commentator Jean Andre Rouquet that the clergyman 
    so deep in his letter to Edmund Gibson that he ignores the girl's plight (as 
    ambitious clerics ignored their flock) was Moll's father. Rouquet had to explain 
    this to his Catholic readers:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>'The 
    clergy in England are not bound to celibacy, and make great use of their privilege. 
    They all marry, and as the revenue of their benefices is not enough for the 
    establishment of several children in the world, these children and above all 
    the daughters, are reduced to strange ways of providing for their own subsistence.'</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>This, too, was an old line: Tom Brown's huge, greasy bawd

    the poor <a

  <p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> 
    </b>There he sits upon the faithful family chattel, a miserable grey who has 
    probably done his best for sixteen years already to support (though, of course, 
    some other of God's creatures could have done it better) the poor equestrian 
    with a wife and ten children living on an income of 150 thalers net in the 
    rich countryside where they all belong. A sorry figure to be sure! The skin 
    on his knees has been kneed through in heavy service, and but perfunctorily 
    patched up again by Nature. The shape of the neck and the position of the 
    legs which have something of the cow about them and something of the lathe, 
    do nothing to improve matters. Nor can one say that the horse, as might sometimes 
    happen, is in the least ennobled by the figure of its rider. In the service 
    of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Holy</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> 
    the latter is in rather the same position as his loyal quadruped would be 
    in any princely stable. He too is old, stiff, tottering, and in heavy service&#8212;bless 
    us!&#8212;he too has worn out his knees, and like his friend is now without 
    hope of a softer bed. Just look at his parched mouth and the highlights on 
    the joints of his shrivelled hands! One would sooner expect to see in them 
    the scythe of the general friend of living nature, than the reins. He sits 
    there in his clerical garb, the only suit left in his wardrobe which could 
    command such respect on the road as would certainly have been denied to the 
    state of innocence underneath; the same applies to the breeches. They are 
    certainly kneed through, and the high shovel hat serves not only for ornament 
    but is at the same time a protection against mockery and moths. Every ornament 
    in the world ought to be of that sort: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>decus 
    et tutamen.</i> The bleached, washed out and thinned out wig is of great significance 
    here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not very thoughtful of the Reformation 
    to allow the tonsure, which after all can be undone by Nature, to be covered 
    by a wig, and yet to deprive a tonsured wig, which is much more difficult 
    to restore, of the covering of the monk's hood, which would have concealed 
    all deficiency. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    we have not the least idea of what the English clergyman's wig is like. Haven't 
    we really?&#8212;No! And if anyone tries to contradict me, I shall say outright 
    that in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
    we simply do not know at all what a wig is. Ours are mere anatomical specimens 
    of wigs. In short: as regards dignity and impressiveness they are the exact 
    counterpart of the beard of the ancients, with this difference only, that 
    the hair is fixed on the other side of the face. And the form of it? Very 
    well, I will describe the clergyman's wig, in its flowering time of course, 
    in the manner of Linnaeus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone 
    knows how onions blossom. The little flowers form together a sort of sphere 
    which is set high and firmly at the end of a long stem, as if on a spit. Now 
    imagine the hollow stem to be the neck, and imagine from that sphere as many 
    little flowers cut away in front as would be needful to accommodate a mask, 
    and from the top as many as needful to accommodate a hat, but with no mask 
    or hat there, and you have exactly the shape and even the colour of the English 
    clergyman's wig. I do not know whether it is a deranged imagination or some 
    other metastasis of the poetic gift in me, but often on fine summer evenings, 
    when I could no longer clearly discern the thin, hollow stems, I could not 
    help comparing a field of onions in flower with an English Church Convention. 
    Now let us cast a final glance at that washed-out sheepskin of a poor man 
    there upon the grey. Hogarth speaks here to our hearts, and Heaven forbid 
    that we should add the smallest touch which would lead in a different direction. 
    He speaks, I say, straight to the heart of those in this world who know what 
    an amount of brushing and rubbing and combing it must have cost the honest 
    man before he arrived at the point, through no fault of his own, of being 
    no longer able to display in public the miserable insignia of his state and 
    order; the order to which, in the eyes of the eternal Judge, he will often 
    do more honour than his temporal Superior. I am in earnest here, my dear reader, 
    and therefore I beg your attention for another moment. Oh, if this figure 
    of death would but once ride as if alive, like Lenore's Wilhelm, over the 
    ceiling of the Hall where the Bishop or the Rector are at their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Te 
    Deum</i>&#8212;by feasting, or if he rode his screw across the path on which 
    they gallop in coach and four, and if they were to recognize in that image 
    a man of their own flesh and blood and calling (of their wig, one might almost 
    say) who despite his greater merit had made his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Te 
    Deum</i>&#8212;by hungering all his life, it would be better for the poor 
    clergy in rich England. But that is poetry: away with it&#8212;in times like 
    these (5-7).</p>
