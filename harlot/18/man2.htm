  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><font color="#8000FF">Paulson <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hogarth&#8217;s 
    Graphic Works: </i></font></b>The man in the doorway of the inn is <a href="man1.htm">Colonel 
    Francis Charteris</a>, or &quot;Chartres,&quot; a name almost proverbial for 
    vice, who had also died shortly before the appearance of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A Harlot's Progress</i> (Feb. 24, 1731/2). (Cf. the mezzotint portrait 
    by G. White, 1730, BM. Sat. 1840.) The man behind him is &quot;a Pimp, whom 
    he always kept about his person&quot; (J. Nichols, Biog. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Anecd</i>., 1782, p. i59); perhaps John Gourlay (called &quot;Trusty Jack&quot;) 
    or Anthony Henley. Charteris, by birth a gentleman, amassed a large fortune 
    by gambling and lending back his winnings on the security of the loser's property; 
    by this means and by clever speculation he collected a number of profitable 
    estates. But his greatest fame was as a seducer or rapist of women. On one 
    occasion a woman's rumor that her sister was in Charteris' house was sufficient 
    to draw a mob clamoring for her release (she emerged, explaining that she 
    did not wish to be released). Charteris went so far as to project a charity 
    school for his natural children and draw up plans for alms houses for women 
    who claimed he had ruined them. Age made his obsession more difficult, and 
    at forty-six he was condemned to death for the rape of a girl he met m a country 
    lane near Edinburgh; again in 1730, at fifty-five, he was condemned to death 
    for luring a servant girl to his house and raping her. Both times his powerful 
    friends and his fortune saved him, though at considerable expense. (As it 
    happened, Francis Hackabout, Kate&#8217;s brother, was sentenced to hang at 
    the same time and place that Charteris was sentenced a second time for rape. 
    Moreover, the same issue of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-street 
    Journal</i> that mentions Kate Hackabout gives [in the next column] an account 
    of Charteris and his wife, who, having become &quot;perfectly reconciled to 
    each other,&quot; and his having &quot;cashiered his trusty Jack and others 
    of his evil agents,... are to be presented to their majesties one day this 
    weeck.&quot; This ironic juxtaposition may have inspired Hogarth to bring 
    the two together in his print.).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Charteris' 
    method of seduction was to post agents in innyards to spot newly-arrived girls 
    from the country, and (like Richardson's Mr. B.) to employ the girl as a servant 
    in his house (see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Some Authentick Memoirs 
    of the Life of Colonel Ch-------s, Rape-Master of Great Britain by an Impartial 
    Hand,</i> 1730). The attacks on him by satirists and moralists are legion; 
    he appears as an exemplum in Pope's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Essay 
    on Man</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>4, Moral Essays</i>, 3, 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Epilogue to the Satires</i>, 1, and imitations 
    of Horace's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Satire II.</i>i, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Epistle I</i>.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>6</i>, and Donne's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Satire 2</i>; 
    and he is summed up unsympathetically in Dr. Arbuthnot&#8217;s &quot;Epitaph&quot; 
    on him (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 2, 
    W2 718). Indeed, when he died, two years after his last rape trial, the people 
    of his neighborhood attacked the hearse, strewed it with refuse, tried to 
    tear his body from the coffin, and threw the carcasses of dogs and cats into 
    the tomb (144). <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span></p>

    and looks on with a lickerish grin. Like Mother Needham, he had recently died&#8212;during 
    the course of the previous year, at the age of sixty-two, having persevered 
    (observed a satirical epitaph) &#8220;with an inflexible constancy and inimitable 
    uniformity . . . in the practice of every human vice, excepting prodigality 
    and hypocrisy&#8221;: he was exempted from the latter by his &#8220;matchless

    the second occasion, however, not without imprisonment in Newgate&#8221; and 
    large financial penalties; and, when he died in Scotland in 1731, the legend 
    of Francis Chartres had grown so dark and widespread that his funeral procession 
    provoked a serious riot, his body was nearly torn from the coffin, and the 
    indignant mob hurled &#8220;dead dogs &amp;c. into the grave along with it&#8221;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
