    and was severely handled by the populace.&quot; And again: &quot;She was so

    . . . As early as March 1722/3 Mother Needham was keeping her &#8220;Vaulting-School 
    in <span class=SpellE>Pulteney</span>-Street&#8221; and was arrested with 
    seventeen (or twelve in another source) &#8220;of her Daughters.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>She was committed to the Gatehouse and immediately freed on bail; the 
    girls went to <span
class=SpellE>Tothill</span> Fields <span class=SpellE>Bridewell</span> to beat 
    hemp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In May she had moved her house, 
    and on <st1:date year="1724" day="21" month="7">21 July 1724</st1:date> she 
    was apprehended again; &#8220;the first time Mrs. Needham ever received Correction,

    the first of a series of calculated reports of her death appeared, with an 
    epitaph in verse about her dying from being pelted in the pillory&#8212;a 
    grisly prophecy, as it happened. . . .On Friday 30 April, a month after <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    had begun his subscription for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Harlot&#8217;s 
    Progress,</i> &#8220;the noted&#8221; Mother Needham stood in the pillory 
    facing Park Place and was so &#8220;severely handled by the populace&#8221; 
    that she died on 3 May without having to stand again in the pillory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#8220;She declared in her last words, that 
    what most affected her was the terror of standing in the pillory tomorrow 
    in New Palace-Yard, having been so ungratefully used by the Populace on Wednesday.&#8221;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>And the <i

    very ungratefully, considering how much she had done to oblige them&#8221;&#8212;a 
    statement that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> would have found very interesting. 
    . . .She is of course the Harlot&#8217;s original corrupter, the bawd who 
    usually escaped detention while her girls beat hemp; yet she is only an intermediary 
    for the <span class=SpellE>Charterises</span>, and her death, analogous to 
    the Harlot&#8217;s, is an ugly one, with the very people she has served clamoring 
    for her punishment (vol. 1 251-252).</p>

    is Her Ladyship, an old cunning decoy-bird, who as a rule sings only bawdy 
    songs, but on occasions like these still knows how to pipe her woodland airs 
    and to lure the free flight of the little birds of heaven towards the cages 
    of London. A notorious woman who, though not hanged, met a death which in 
    shamefulness was only a few degrees removed from death on the gallows, and 
    which in every other respect was much more painful. It is in fact a portrait 
    of a Madam Needham, commonly known as Mother Needham, a notorious and generally 
    despised character of those times. She kept a bawdy house in <st1:Street><st1:address>Park 
    Place</st1:address></st1:Street>, a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cul-de-sac,</i> 
    if I am not mistaken, off St. James's Street, one of the main thoroughfares 
    of the City. She was called 'Mother', no doubt, because she had the virtue 
    and <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of her pupils just as much at heart as 
    her own. Pope has immortalized her too. He calls her 'pious <st1:City><st1:place>Needham</st1:place></st1:City>'.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To call a go-between and procuress 'pious' merely 
    in irony would have been a far too commonplace joke for so witty a man. No; 
    she really was pious, and exercised her piety, as it is exercised by thousands, 
    regularly, according to the clock. She washed herself morning and evening 
    with her prayers, according to the best prescriptions, and every Sunday she 
    had a grand washing day; the remaining time she spent in her office or was 
    otherwise occupied. One might perhaps imagine she was a religious hypocrite. 
    That sort of thing would depreciate Pope's remark still more, for what is 
    more common than procuresses who are also hypocrites? No; she is said to have 
    really thought sometimes when she prayed, which is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>differentia 
    <span class=SpellE>specifica</span>,</i> and thus Pope's comment acquires 
    significance. It was expressly remembered of her that she often implored Heaven 
    with tears for a blessing on her occupation, so that she might one day freed 
    from shame, serve Heaven fully in spirit and in truth. Was this a pious fraud? 
    Heaven declined to grant that well-meant request. She was arrested, put in 
    the pillory, and on the second occasion (she was to undergo the operation 
    three times) was so badly mauled by the rabble on the maxim: 'I love treason 
    but hate the traitor', that she died before it came to the third ordeal. This 
    was indeed worse than a hanging.</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Here she stands, albeit rather weathered; the
facing begins to crumble just like the wall of the alehouse which serves as a
significant background to her head. In order, however, to impede as far as
possible the flight of her remaining charms, she has stuck little plasters over
the main avenues of escape, through which they usually disappear, while the
faded ones have evidently been freshened up. I may be mistaken, but whenever I
look at that nose I cannot help thinking of snuff and spectacle marks. Besides,
one can very well see how the face, especially that delightful mouth, is doing
everything it can to mask the repellent traces which the habits of fifty years
have left in some of its regions. To bring her heart close to the poor girl's
through her finger tips, she has taken off her glove, for the theatrical
gesture which she is performing would not penetrate through calf skin. And so
the poor little bird sinks into a charmed sleep while being put into the cage
of a seemingly great lady, a cage however which has a little back gate through
Charters' hedge, and so&#8212;everything is lost' And all this is happening
while our good old man m poring over an address forgets to alight from his
horse. Thus here is another case of fragile goods&#8212;tumbling down, to the
detriment of the poor devil, which no bishopric will ever restore. So much for
a letter of introduction! (13-14)</p>
