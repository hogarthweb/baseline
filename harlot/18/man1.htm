    Graphic Works: </i></font></b>The man in the doorway of the inn is Colonel 
    Francis Charteris, or &quot;Chartres,&quot; a name almost proverbial for vice, 
    who had also died shortly before the appearance of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A 
    Harlot's Progress</i> (Feb. 24, 1731/2). (Cf. the mezzotint portrait by G. 
    White, 1730, BM. Sat. 1840.) The <a href="man2.htm">man behind him</a> is 
    &quot;a Pimp, whom he always kept about his person&quot; (J. Nichols, Biog. 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Anecd</i>., 1782, p. i59); perhaps John Gourlay 
    (called &quot;Trusty Jack&quot;) or Anthony Henley. Charteris, by birth a 
    gentleman, amassed a large fortune by gambling and lending back his winnings 
    on the security of the loser's property; by this means and by clever speculation 
    he collected a number of profitable estates. But his greatest fame was as 
    a seducer or rapist of women. On one occasion a woman's rumor that her sister 
    was in Charteris' house was sufficient to draw a mob clamoring for her release 
    (she emerged, explaining that she did not wish to be released). Charteris 
    went so far as to project a charity school for his natural children and draw 
    up plans for alms houses for women who claimed he had ruined them. Age made 
    his obsession more difficult, and at forty-six he was condemned to death for 
    the rape of a girl he met m a country lane near Edinburgh; again in 1730, 
    at fifty-five, he was condemned to death for luring a servant girl to his 
    house and raping her. Both times his powerful friends and his fortune saved 
    him, though at considerable expense. (As it happened, Francis Hackabout, Kate&#8217;s 
    brother, was sentenced to hang at the same time and place that Charteris was 
    sentenced a second time for rape. Moreover, the same issue of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-street 
    Journal</i> that mentions Kate Hackabout gives [in the next column] an account 
    of Charteris and his wife, who, having become &quot;perfectly reconciled to 
    each other,&quot; and his having &quot;cashiered his trusty Jack and others 
    of his evil agents,... are to be presented to their majesties one day this 
    weeck.&quot; This ironic juxtaposition may have inspired Hogarth to bring 
    the two together in his print.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Charteris' 
    method of seduction was to post agents in innyards to spot newly-arrived girls 
    from the country, and (like Richardson's Mr. B.) to employ the girl as a servant 
    in his house (see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Some Authentick Memoirs 
    of the Life of Colonel Ch-------s, Rape-Master of Great Britain by an Impartial 
    Hand,</i> 1730). The attacks on him by satirists and moralists are legion; 
    he appears as an exemplum in Pope's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Essay 
    on Man</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>4, Moral Essays</i>, 3, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Satire II.</i>i, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Epistle I</i>.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>6</i>, and Donne's 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Satire 2</i>; and he is summed up unsympathetically 
    in Dr. Arbuthnot&#8217;s &quot;Epitaph&quot; on him (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 2, W2 718). Indeed, when he died, two years 
    after his last rape trial, the people of his neighborhood attacked the hearse, 
    strewed it with refuse, tried to tear his body from the coffin, and threw 
    the carcasses of dogs and cats into the tomb (144). <span style='mso-tab-count:

    . . . in the practice of every human vice, excepting prodigality and hypocrisy&#8221;: 
    he was exempted from the latter by his &#8220;matchless impudence&#8221;,

    grown so dark and widespread that his funeral procession provoked a serious 
    riot, his body was nearly torn from the coffin, and the indignant mob hurled 
    &#8220;dead dogs &amp;c. into the grave along with it&#8221;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> </b>The man who stands here 
    with one foot in the courtyard and the other still in the doorway, with the 
    left hand resting on a stick, and the right engaged in some private business, 
    is the notorious Colonel Charters. Those who know how readily Hogarth could 
    hit off a face and figure must be gratified to see preserved upon this Plate 
    the physiognomy and form of one of the greatest scoundrels the stylus has 
    ever rendered immortal. Two of the actors in our drama die on the gallows, 
    but that man is not one of them, though he deserved it just as much. He only 
    escaped hanging because in addition to the numerous fraudulent practices which 
    lead to the gallows, in all of which he was a past master, he had been clever 
    enough to study that one by which the gallows themselves are deprived of their 
    due. Never, perhaps, had the gallows been so cheated as on the day when that 
    beast died in his bed. For those of our readers who are familiar with Pope, 
    Swift, Arbuthnot, and in general with the English classical writers of that 
    time, or who have found pleasure in studying the spirit and character of that 
    nation great even in its monstrosities, as they annually come before its Criminal 
    Courts, we are not recording anything new here. Felon, scoundrel, whoremonger, 
    are so many descriptions of Colonel Charters. Pope, to put it in a nutshell, 
    once spoke of 'Charters and the Devil'. Charters and the Devil. That sounds 
    almost like a Trading Company. They had indeed a sort of traffic with one 
    another just as the French Charters has nowadays with those hotter regions. 
    And it would not, I think, have shamed the Devil to sign some of his newest 
    bills on <st1:City><st1:place>Nantes</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:City><st1:place>Bordeaux</st1:place></st1:City> 
    with 'Charters, Bros. &amp; Co.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.3pt;text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:
none'>Now to a more detailed description of the creature. We shall begin with
Pope's own note on the passage we mentioned; in cold-blooded prose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.3pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Francis Charters, a man infamous for all
manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army he was drummed out of the
regiment for a cheat; he was next banished <st1:City><st1:place>Brussels</st1:place></st1:City>
and drummed out of <st1:City><st1:place>Ghent</st1:place></st1:City> on the
same account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming tables he took to lending
money at exorbitant interest and on great penalties, accumulating premium,
interest, and capital into a new capital, and seizing to a minute when the
payments became due; in a word, by a constant attention to the vices, wants and
follies of mankind, he acquired an immense fortune. His house was a perpetual
bawdy-house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was twice condemned for
rapes, and pardoned; but the last time not without imprisonment in Newgate, and
large confiscations. He died in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Scotland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1731, aged 62. The populace at his funeral raised a great riot, almost tore
the body out of the coffin, and cast dead dogs, etc., into the grave along with
it.</p>

we never read such epitaphs in churchyards? Indeed, when we walk through a
churchyard and read the stone receipts which our common mother draws up in
exchange for the nailed-up boxes deposited with her, one cannot help thinking
that she must either be a very rich and kindly mother who intends one day to
make good the defects out of her own means, or a very foolish one who lets
herself be taken in quite lamentably by some of those bereaved families. I must
confess that when I read the inscriptions on tombstones I am often at a loss to
know which is really the side of glory. For there could surely be no happier
world than one where the graves gave up without the smallest rebate everything
which according to the tombstone inscriptions they had received; or one in
which all those who escaped hanging really were such paragons as are said to
have been delivered here. </p>

consignment of girls from <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>. The fellow behind
him is a certain John Gourlay, who usually accompanied Charters, especially
when something was to be acquired for the household, a sort of blood-hound.
About the lips of that noble pair there hovers an expression, not so much
ingratiating as actually of savouring something, which has such an abominable
effect that it might tempt the hand of any honest and honour-loving fellow to
apply itself thereto in the form of a fist, and with accelerated motion,
without any more ado. They have, however, no confidence in their own appearance
when confronting innocence and have found it necessary to interpose between
themselves and the poor inexperienced village girl a little object of
attraction (9-13).</p>
