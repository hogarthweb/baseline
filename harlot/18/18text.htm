    Consideration of poor and <span class=SpellE>publick</span> Whores&quot; in 
    Spectator No. 266 (Jan. 4, 1711/12), where he mentioned seeing the &quot;most 
    artful Procuress in the Town, examining a most beautiful Country-Girl, who 
    had come up in the same <span class=SpellE>Waggon</span> with my Things.&quot; 
    The scene is the yard of the Bell Inn, where coaches from the country stopped; 
    there was an inn of this name in Wood Street, Cheap- side. The girl wears 
    the dress of a country girl, a kerchief and a full- blown rose hiding her 
    bosom; a pincushion and a pair of scissors hang at her waist. The wagon has

    the place from which she came—far from <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city> 
    and its intrigues—and also suggesting that the girl cannot afford a stagecoach. 
    Stephens (BM Sat.) detected &quot;with much simplicity of expression . . . 
    , a voluptuous character in her features, and a certain frivolity.&quot; Her 
    name, we learn in Pls. 3 and 6, is <span class=GramE>M[</span><span class=SpellE>ary</span>?] 
    <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> (initials &quot;M.H.&quot; are on her

    in London,</i>&quot; bears a striking resemblance to her, and implies her 
    own fate, as she listens to Mother Needham's blandishments. The meaning of 
    her name is clear enough: hack is a carriage for hire, and about implies street-walking. 
    There was, however, a prostitute of this name (her Christian name, Kate) who 
    appears in a list of women taken into custody for disorderly conduct (Grub-street 
    Journal, Aug. 6, 1730): &quot;the famous Kate <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> 
    (whose brother was lately <span class=SpellE>hang'd</span> at <span

    for being a very termagant, and a terror, not only to the civil part of the 
    <span

    in the streets in the night-time, but also to other women of her own profession,

    (called &quot;Trusty Jack&quot;) or Anthony Henley. <span class=SpellE>Charteris</span>, 
    by birth a gentleman, amassed a large fortune by gambling and lending back 
    his winnings on the security of the loser's property; by this means and by 
    clever speculation he collected a number of profitable estates. But his greatest 
    fame was as a seducer or rapist of women. On one occasion a woman's rumor 
    that her sister was in <span class=SpellE>Charteris</span>' house was sufficient 
    to draw a mob clamoring for her release (she emerged, explaining that she 
    did not wish to be released). <span class=SpellE>Charteris</span> went so 
    far as to project a charity school for his natural children and draw up plans 
    for alms houses for women who claimed he had ruined them. Age made his obsession 
    more difficult, and at forty-six he was condemned to death for the rape of 
    a girl he met m a country lane near Edinburgh; again in 1730, at fifty-five, 
    he was condemned to death for luring a servant girl to his house and raping 
    her. Both times his powerful friends and his fortune saved him, though at 
    considerable expense. (As it happened, Francis <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span>, 
    Kate’s brother, was sentenced to hang at the same time and place that <span class=SpellE>Charteris</span> 
    was sentenced a second time for rape. Moreover, the same issue of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-street Journal</i> that mentions Kate 
    <span
class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> gives [in the next column] an account of <span
class=SpellE>Charteris</span> and his wife, who, having become &quot;perfectly 
    reconciled to each other,&quot; and his having &quot;cashiered his trusty 
    Jack and others of his evil agents,... are to be presented to their majesties 
    one day this <span class=SpellE>weeck</span>.&quot; This ironic juxtaposition 
    may have inspired <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> to bring the two together 
    in his print.) </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=SpellE>Charteris</span>' method of seduction 
    was to post agents in <span class=SpellE>innyards</span> to spot newly-arrived 
    girls from the country, and (like Richardson's Mr. B.) to employ the girl 
    as a servant in his house (see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Some

    Magazine</i>, 2, W2 718). Indeed, when he died, two years after his last rape

    showed her trying to peddle a girl “just come out of the country.” . . . As 
    early as March 1722/3 Mother Needham was keeping her “Vaulting-School in <span
class=SpellE>Pulteney</span>-Street” and was arrested with seventeen (or twelve 
    in another source) “of her Daughters.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She 
    was committed to the Gatehouse and immediately freed on bail; the girls went 
    to <span class=SpellE>Tothill</span> Fields <span class=SpellE>Bridewell</span> 
    to beat hemp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In May she had moved 
    her house, and on 21 July 1724 she was apprehended again; “the first time 
    Mrs. Needham ever received Correction, since her being at the Head of <span
class=SpellE>Veneal</span> Affairs in this Town.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the next day she was again bailed.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In October 
    1726 the first of a series of calculated reports of her death appeared, with 
    an epitaph in verse about her dying from being pelted in the pillory—a grisly 
    prophecy, as it happened. . . .On Friday 30 April, a month after <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> had begun his subscription for the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Harlot’s Progress,</i> “the noted” Mother Needham 
    stood in the pillory facing Park Place and was so “severely handled by the 
    populace” that she died on 3 May without having to stand again in the pillory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>“She declared in her last words, that what most affected her was the 
    terror of standing in the pillory tomorrow in New Palace-Yard, having been 
    so ungratefully used by the Populace on Wednesday.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
    </span>And the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-Street Journal</i> adds, “They acted very 
    ungratefully, considering how much she had done to oblige them”—a statement 
    that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> would have found very interesting. 
    . . .She is of course the Harlot’s original corrupter, the bawd who usually 
    escaped detention while her girls beat hemp; yet she is only an intermediary 
    for the <span class=SpellE>Charterises</span>, and her death, analogous to 
    the Harlot’s, is an ugly one, with the very people she has served clamoring 
    for her punishment.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There are 
    at least three circles of guilt in Plate 1: the girl herself; Mother Needham 
    who is exploiting her; and <span class=SpellE>Charteris</span>, who is exploiting 
    Mother Needham, and will no doubt be one of those who pelt her in the pillory.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The clergyman 
    is also part of the guilt explored in Plate 1, turning his back on <span

    and <a href="man1.htm"><span class=SpellE>Charteris</span>,</a> while his 
    horse is casually knocking over a pile of <a href="buckets.htm">buckets</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reason for his absorption is the address 
    he is trying to make out on the paper in his hand: “to the Right Reverend 
    Father in God . . . London.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reference 
    is to Bishop Gibson of London, who was Sir Robert Walpole’s chief adviser 
    in the matter of ecclesiastical preferment: the clergyman is thinking about 
    his advancement rather than his duty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    even incriminated the girl’s “<span
class=SpellE>lofing</span> <span class=SpellE>cosen</span> in <st1:street><st1:address><span
  class=SpellE>Tems</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> in <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>,”

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Thus the

We see both father and daughter in the first Plate. The girl, standing in the
foreground, has just got down from the wretched <a href="wagon.htm">cart</a>
which, as appears from its superscription, has brought her from the country;
the father in the background is not so much riding as merely straddling his
horse. How the girl stands there! Of course she is not a great beauty—one can
see that. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> was no painter of beauty; as far as
I know, only two people in his whole life have claimed this for him: one was <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> himself and the other his good wife. But what the
girl lacks in refinement is more than compensated by good health, childish
simplicity, and gentle innocence. Her manner is that of a sturdy, clean,
well-behaved village girl, who could be made into something—and that is just
what happens. Her figure seems to have developed somewhat on the broad side, in
the rough service of Ceres and <st1:City><st1:place>Pomona</st1:place></st1:City>.
Had she been gathering forget-me-nots, daisies, violets and all the rest of the
sentimental love-posies, she would perhaps have been cast in a finer mould.
However, she is still in her middle teens, and still growing, and doubtless
much of the angularity in her appearance must be put to the account of the
village tailor.</p>

without bragging, and with the least possible display, like honeycombs. There
are no unoccupied <span class=SpellE>storeys</span> in the <span class=GramE>former,</span>
and in the latter no empty galleries. Her face which reposes under the former
speaks for itself in eloquent silence, is understandable to all and open to
all, and needs no interpretation; to what is beneath the latter, on the other
hand, where only conjectures are permitted, Flora has given an almost
superfluous security by fixing a little rose there: innocence with the bloom of
youth. From here the fortification proceeds downwards in the usual manner with
three-or four-fold wall right to the little feet, standing very general in
parallel. If the commander is not susceptible to bribery, then, as far as that
quarter is concerned, the campaign looks promising. At her side <span
class=GramE>hangs</span> a needle-case and a little pair of scissors, and from
her right arm a small bundle: they were probably put there by the poor weeping
mother when she said goodbye, for occupation and refreshment on the journey.
Much of the utter resignation in the attitude of her arms and the shyness in
her glance are due, however, to the fascination exercised by the elegant watch
of the great lady with whom the good child is here put en rapport.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reader will hear about Her Ladyship in
due course. As yet we have to deal only with innocence, and therefore proceed
immediately to the poor father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There he
sits upon the faithful family chattel, a miserable grey who has probably done
his best for sixteen years already to support (though, of course, some other of
God's creatures could have done it better) the poor equestrian with a wife and
ten children living on an income of 150 <span class=SpellE>thalers</span> net
in the rich countryside where they all belong. A sorry figure to be sure! The
skin on his knees has been kneed through in heavy service, and but
perfunctorily patched up again by Nature. The shape of the neck and the
position of the legs which have something of the cow about them and something
of the lathe, do nothing to improve matters. Nor can one say that the horse, as
might sometimes happen, is in the least ennobled by the figure of its rider. In
the service of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Holy</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
the latter is in rather the same position as his loyal quadruped would be in
any princely stable. He too is old, stiff, tottering, and in heavy
service—bless us!—he too has worn out his knees, and like his friend is now
without hope of a softer bed. Just look at his parched mouth and the highlights
on the joints of his <span class=SpellE>shrivelled</span> hands! One would
sooner expect to see in them the scythe of the general friend of living nature,
than the reins. He sits there in his clerical garb, the only suit left in his
wardrobe which could command such respect on the road as would certainly have
been denied to the state of innocence underneath; the same applies to the
breeches. They are certainly kneed through, and the high shovel hat serves not
only for ornament but is at the same time a protection against mockery and
moths. Every ornament in the world ought to be of that sort: <span

not very thoughtful of the Reformation to allow the tonsure, which after all
can be undone by Nature, to be covered by a wig, and yet to deprive a tonsured
wig, which is much more difficult to restore, of the covering of the monk's
hood, which would have concealed all deficiency. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
we have not the least idea of what the English clergyman's wig is like. Haven't
we really?—No! And if anyone tries to contradict me, I shall say outright that
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> we
simply do not know at all what a wig is. Ours are mere anatomical specimens of
wigs. In short: as regards dignity and impressiveness they are the exact
counterpart of the beard of the ancients, with this difference only, that the
hair is fixed on the other side of the face. <span class=GramE>And the form of
it?</span> Very well, I will describe the clergyman's wig, in its flowering
time of course, in the manner of Linnaeus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Everyone knows how onions blossom. The little flowers form together a sort
of sphere which is set high and firmly at the end of a long stem, as if on a
spit. Now imagine the hollow stem to be the neck, and imagine from that sphere
as many little flowers cut away in front as would be needful to accommodate a
mask, and from the top as many as needful to accommodate a hat, but with no
mask or hat there, and you have exactly the shape and even the <span
class=SpellE>colour</span> of the English clergyman's wig. I do not know
whether it is a deranged imagination or some other metastasis of the poetic
gift in me, but often on fine summer evenings, when I could no longer clearly
discern the thin, hollow stems, I could not help comparing a field of onions in
flower with an English Church Convention. Now let us cast a final glance at
that washed-out sheepskin of a poor man there upon the grey. <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> speaks here to our hearts, and Heaven forbid that
we should add the smallest touch which would lead in a different direction. He
speaks, I say, straight to the heart of those in this world who know what an
amount of brushing and rubbing and combing it must have cost the honest man
before he arrived at the point, through no fault of his own, of being no longer
able to display in public the miserable insignia of his state and order; the
order to which, in the eyes of the eternal Judge, he will often do more <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> than his temporal Superior. I am in earnest here, my
dear reader, and therefore I beg your attention for another moment. Oh, if this
figure of death would but once ride as if alive, like Lenore's Wilhelm, over the
ceiling of the Hall where the Bishop or the Rector are at their <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Te Deum</i>—by feasting, or if he rode his
screw across the path on which they gallop in coach and four, and if they were
to recognize in that image a man of their own flesh and blood and calling (of
their wig, one might almost say) who despite his greater merit had made his <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Te Deum</i>—by hungering all his life, it
would be better for the poor clergy in rich England. But that is poetry: away
with it—in times like these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE>Away with poetry, that is; for we must
still linger a moment with the poor parson and his daughter.</span> The old man
has accompanied her to town, the first of his children to attain by Nature a
sort of currency value in the world, she in the cart and he upon the poor grey.
He had had to choose between two shock machines, and chose for himself the
cheaper, not the more comfortable one. They have just arrived at the Bell Inn
in <st1:Street><st1:address>Wood Street</st1:address></st1:Street>, a
well-known public house. The old man is reading the address on a letter of
introduction: 'To the Right Reverend Bishop—<st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>'.
A testimonial which might hit its <span class=GramE>mark,</span> provided it
was loaded with a bullet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He has not got
his spectacles with him .and is laboriously studying the address. The grey
takes advantage of this moment to make up for what he has missed on the way,
and snatches greedily at the packing straw of some earthenware which is here
displayed for sale. As a result, flower pots, dishes and pans and what-not, all
empty, are tumbling around the famished animal. <span class=GramE>Very ominous.</span>
In all probability, if it comes to an argument, the bill for these empty dishes
will far exceed the price of many a full one which the poor man has denied
himself on the journey, and all that had been saved through the use of the
shock-machine, and (deducting the hopes) the whole value of the letter to the
Right Reverend! But we must leave this woeful scene, for much still lies before
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Farewell then, unhappy pair; we
shall not meet again so soon. Endure in patience a little longer the few blows
of your common fate which may still lie in store until the great knock-out blow
of Nature falls, <span class=GramE>which<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>makes</span> an end of all. It will save you at the same time, my good
old man, from witnessing the unspeakable misery which awaits your beloved
Mary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As yet you do not know that the procession
which you and your faithful servant led here from <st1:City><st1:place>York</st1:place></st1:City>
was a funeral procession in which the virtue and, therefore, the happiness of
your daughter, were conducted to a most terrible grave! And you, faithful grey,
in whose side I discern, just behind your rider's spur, a little spot of
reality which has cost the artist but a slight pressure of his stylus, but has
cost you precious blood; believe me, the discovery has made me feel for you
three times more keenly. I was sorry to discover, so shortly before our
parting, this sign of conjunction between you and your master. But be
comforted! The similarity between the two of you is even greater than you
imagine: he too all his life long has carried just such a merciless rider as
you have, and it would have cost the artist more than a single stroke to depict
the scars which the poor victim covers here with the clerical <span

thus alights at the Bell Inn in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>.
The healthy, country flower is transplanted from its native soil into this
boundless garden amidst fertilizers and insects in a thousand forms, unknown in
<st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>; unfortunately, she just chances to light on
one of the most infamous flower-beds for miles around. Before she has time to
strike root, an insect (I mean here Her Ladyship with the dainty watch) fastens
in its sting, which is to ruin her straight growth for ever, at least upon this
earth. The explanation is as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> makes the girl come from
<st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>. Why from <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place>?
The artist and writer for posterity <span class=GramE>makes</span> no stroke
without meaning. <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place> produces (I speak here as a
statistician) the prettiest girls; that it breeds the finest horses is already
well known. And a <span class=GramE>cart laden</span> with the poorest, though
by no means the plainest, of these creatures puts up every week at the Bell Inn
in <st1:Street><st1:address>Wood Street</st1:address></st1:Street>, or at least
calls there. This is the scene here. <span class=GramE>To paint it yet clearer,
still a few more words.</span> Above the front door we see the chessboard sign:
its meaning has often been a subject of controversy in English journals, and
still is. The dispute however seems now to be resolved. It is the sign which
all houses selling strong spirits are obliged to display. The Warren family,
whose coat-of- arms bears such a chessboard, has in fact up to the present day
the exclusive right of distributing <span class=SpellE>licences</span> to such
retailers, and it is customary, for the convenience of the tax-collector, to
have that chessboard painted over the doorway and on the door posts, so that
the houses can be recognized from a distance. It turns up in various places in
the work of our artist, just like the people who are usually found in such
houses. The courtyard of the <st1:place>Inn</st1:place> is situated, as one
sees, in a miserable quarter. Although there may be houses in the <span
class=SpellE>neighbourhood</span> which have their good side, so much is
certain, they are not turning their more respectable one to us here. For
instance, in the house to the left, on the veranda, which incidentally is
partly propped on posts and partly suspended from poles, we see two inverted
chamber-pots. This seems to be their customary residence during the day, to get
some fresh air; at night they retire dutifully to the service of the family,
whose size is thus indicated by the number of these objects. On the line hangs
the washing, or at least something that was in the water that morning, whether
destined for future use on the human frame or merely for the limbo of the paper
mill would be difficult to decide, from one piece at least. The girl who peers
down is holding either a pair of boots or a pair of stiff stockings which seem
to have a generous admixture of water. Evidently some of it is meant to run
off, and she seems to contemplate a bath of drips for some passers-by with good
hope of success. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Into that wretched hedge-alehouse, disregarding all the
misery around, has ventured the man with the somewhat ungainly calves whom we
now see standing in the doorway. That there is a <a href="man2.htm">servant</a>
with hair-bag, evidently a most devoted one, standing behind him, leads us to
expect something high-class. He has come here expressly to wait for the cart
with the <st1:place>Yorkshire</st1:place> girls so as to have first <span

class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> could hit off a face and figure must be gratified
to see preserved upon this Plate the physiognomy and form of one of the
greatest scoundrels the stylus has ever rendered immortal. Two of the actors in
our drama die on the gallows, but that man is not one of them, though he
deserved it just as much. He only escaped hanging because in addition to the
numerous fraudulent practices which lead to the gallows, in all of which he was
a past master, he had been clever enough to study that one by which the gallows
themselves are deprived of their due. Never, perhaps, had the gallows been so
cheated as on the day when that beast died in his bed. For those of our readers
who are familiar with Pope, Swift, <span class=SpellE>Arbuthnot</span>, and in
general with the English classical writers of that time, or who have found
pleasure in studying the spirit and character of that nation great even in its
monstrosities, as they annually come before its Criminal Courts, we are not
recording anything new here. Felon, scoundrel, whoremonger, are so many
descriptions of Colonel Charters. Pope, to put it in a nutshell, once spoke of
'Charters and the Devil'. <span class=GramE>Charters and the Devil.</span> That
sounds almost like a Trading Company. They had indeed a sort of traffic with
one another just as the French Charters has nowadays with those hotter regions.
And it would not, I think, have shamed the Devil to sign some of his newest
bills on Nantes and Bordeaux with 'Charters, Bros. &amp; Co.' </p>

to lending money at exorbitant interest and on great penalties, accumulating
premium, interest, and capital into a new capital, and seizing to a minute when
the payments became due; in a word, by a constant attention to the vices, wants

merely in irony would have been a far too commonplace joke for so witty a man.
No; she really was pious, and exercised her piety, as it is exercised by
thousands, regularly, according to the clock. She washed herself morning and
evening with her prayers, according to the best prescriptions, and every Sunday
she had a grand washing day; the remaining time she spent in her office or was
otherwise occupied. One might perhaps imagine she was a religious hypocrite.
That sort of thing would depreciate Pope's remark still more, for what is more
common than procuresses who are also hypocrites? No; she is said to have really
thought sometimes when she prayed, which is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>differentia
<span class=SpellE>specifica</span>,</i> and thus Pope's comment acquires
significance. It was expressly remembered of her that she often implored Heaven
with tears for a blessing on her occupation, so that she might one day freed
from shame, serve Heaven fully in spirit and in truth. Was this a pious fraud?
Heaven declined to grant that well-meant request. She was arrested, put in the
pillory, and on the second occasion (she was to undergo the operation three
times) was so badly mauled by the rabble on the maxim: 'I love treason but hate
the traitor', that she died before it came to the third ordeal. This was indeed
worse than a hanging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Here she stands,
albeit rather weathered; the facing begins to crumble just like the wall of the
alehouse which serves as a significant background to her head. In order,
however, to impede as far as possible the flight of her remaining charms, she
has stuck little plasters over the main avenues of escape, through which they
usually disappear, while the faded ones have evidently been freshened up. I may
be mistaken, but whenever I look at that nose I cannot help thinking of snuff
and spectacle marks. Besides, one can very well see how the face, especially
that delightful mouth, is doing everything it can to mask the repellent traces
which the habits of fifty years have left in some of its regions. To bring her
heart close to the poor girl's through her finger tips, she has taken off her
glove, <span class=GramE>for</span> the theatrical gesture which she is
performing would not penetrate through calf skin. And so the poor little bird
sinks into a charmed sleep while being put into the cage of a seemingly great
lady, a cage however which has a little back gate through Charters' hedge, and
so—everything is lost' And all this is happening while our good old man m
poring over an address forgets to alight from his horse. Thus here is another
case of fragile goods—tumbling down, to the detriment of the poor devil, which
no bishopric will ever restore. So much for a letter of introduction! <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.3pt;text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'><span class=GramE>So much for the essential features
of this first scene.</span> <span class=GramE>Now a little more about the
decorations.</span> In the lower right-hand corner stands quite a sizeable
trunk with M.H. painted on the lid. It contains the girl's trousseau for this
marriage others with—shame and destruction. With a sort of prophetic foresight
which nothing in the world can justify, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has
given his heroine the name of Mary <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span>, thus
not so much expressing her character as her future fate. This would have been
better left undone. The English word 'to hack', if used of a woman, denotes
every possible shame which could be put to her account. <span class=SpellE>Mamselle</span>
Maria Everybody's would be the most literal translation, and this is at least
free of the ugly associations from which the English word can only with
difficulty be separated, including even saddle and reins. Why this in such a
work of art? And if the girl's name was <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span>,
what was then the name of the poor innocent father? It is to the credit of the
Germans that they do not permit, or only reluctantly, such treason of writers against
their heroes. Woe to the author who has to give his hero a label in order to
draw attention to him. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> was least of all in
need of such a device. He sets forth the girl's story in such a way, and
describes her life so clearly, that in the end one would have to regard her as
a <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> even if the saddler had nailed 'Susannah'
upon the trunk. And this, I think, is the right way. In Greek or Hebrew such
names may perhaps pass; one has grown accustomed to them, just as one is used
to 'Doctor' and '<span class=SpellE>Magister</span>' which nowadays begin to
acquire the character of Christian names. The love of God of some <span
class=SpellE>Theophilus</span> is of about the same degree as the blessed state
of some <span class=SpellE>aetheist</span> Benedict, like Spinoza. Little <span
class=SpellE>Pandemos</span> would have been perhaps the most suitable name if <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> had wanted to indicate his intentions. So far as I
know the name does not appear in any calendar, unless perhaps in a ladies'
calendar, and those I do not read. Close to the <a href="boxandbasket.htm">trunk
lies a poor goose</a> almost strangled by the address label round its neck (in
a way, like the poor parson on horseback through his). It reads: '<span
class=SpellE>te</span> my <span class=SpellE>lofing</span> <span class=SpellE>Cosen</span>
in Terns-street in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>.' <span
class=GramE>New orthography with old-time folly in sisterly conjunction as
usual.</span> Where now is little <span class=SpellE>Pandernos</span> to go?
For in Thames Street, one of the most roaring and crowded thoroughfares in
London, live <span class=SpellE>lofing</span> <span class=SpellE>Cosens</span>
by the thousand who are only too willing to accept unlabelled geese with their
heart in their mouth. The poor animal is addressed, just like you, my good
little Mary, and like your poor Yorkshire <span class=SpellE>travelling</span>
companions in the cart who are going on farther and who will not lack <span
class=SpellE>lofing</span> <span class=SpellE>Cosens</span>, either! Lying on
the ground is a packed case also with an address. We mention this merely to
tell the reader that the address upon the original is intentionally just as
unreadable as here. It is merely something typical which is always happening, a
box waiting patiently for the <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span> of <span
class=GramE>its</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cite <span
class=SpellE>citissime</span></i> until in the end an honest carrier who cannot
read, or a sly thief<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>who does not
want to, takes charge of it (4-15).</p>
