  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg: </font></b>Thrown 
    away, no doubt, by <a
href="../18/man1.htm">Charters</a> (for with him girls shared the fate of playing 
    cards in great Faro banks; he was soon done with them, but they passed on 
    to others like new), she has now been acquired by a wealthy <a
href="man1.htm">Old Testament sinner</a>. She appears here as the mistress of 
    a Portuguese Jew. He keeps her, as one sees, with Jewish splendour; all is 
    somewhat rich, somewhat heavy; also sometimes, like the girl, somewhat second-hand 
    but always of good value in the fraternity. But more about that later. Honour 
    to whom honour is due. First Molly Hackabout. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>In
Heaven's name, just compare this figure with that piece of carved wood on the
first Plate. How quickly its feet could acquire pretty ankles upon the slippery
ice of <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>! There she stood like
a slow, honest, good and clumsy animal, a plump pug-dog, everything parallel,
indifferent to rest or motion. Here, though seated, is she not the living image
of mobility? A whippet like a china ornament, poised rather than standing upon
its three little legs, and the energy which it cannot expend on running is
expressed at least by trembling; ever divided between Heaven and Earth. And her
face! Is that caricature? Do you really think so? Ah, my good Hogarth, they
still call you&#8212;you the painter of souls&#8212;a caricaturist, but take
comfort. Those who so mistake you are very commonplace people. How to scrape
laboriously together from little pots of paint a Greek stone-face with blind
eyeballs cribbed from some concealed original, that you understand just as well
as they did, and as well as hundreds of your countrymen all of whom are
forgotten, whereas you live on, and always will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>I have drawn attention to the face. To understand it
thoroughly we must now explain the whole scene, in rough outline first and then
in detail. The girl is the mistress of this Israelite who has rented a room for
her far away from his office and, perhaps, from his honest wife, where he can
visit her at his convenience, at any hour of the day, counting the day as
twenty-four hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Greater impertinence
in the eyes of a girl still in her teens, greater familiarity with all the
practices of harlotry, combined with the knowledge of a still greater unused
stock in reserve, could hardly be better expressed in so few strokes. In the
whole face no line and no contrasting shadow, and yet how eloquent! 'See,
fellow, not so much do I care for you and your wretched plunder; a fig for
it!', and with a snap of her finger she indicates exactly how much she thinks
of the plunder. It is half a finger joint and a little sound that she brings to
his notice. The right eye has something indescribably scornful. But the fellow
has money and that is an important item which the left eye clearly recognizes.
The feint is, I think, quite unmistakable. On her whole right wing, war is
declared, while the left is at peace, or at least, some admission is made there
of guilt. On the right wing the knee is raised at least a few hands above the
line of modesty, and in an ugly way, so that the tip of the foot is turned
inwards; and the arm stretched out so that in the Quart she brings the snap of
her fingers as close beneath the enemy's nose as if it were a pinch of snuff.
The bracelet is missing. Where could it have been left last night? I have
searched the departing lover for it more than once, but in vain. The upper part
of the body leans over to support the lunge with its weight, and the head is
drawn back to support it with contempt. The bosom presses forward, not as an
offensive measure, of course, but the impertinence of the right side is
palpably increased thereby. I have also read somewhere that a besieged enemy
was once harassed, not only by cannon balls, but also in a most grievous manner
by roast geese and wheaten bread which were displayed to him on a turnspit from
afar. It is said that this form of attack was much more painful than the other
because there was nothing with which to counter it, and every shot was a hit.
On the left flank all is much more compliant, even the pretty arm speaks only
of affability. I have seen them sometimes like that, when there was no enemy
about, but merely an innocent neighbour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We still cannot get away from that little head. If the
whole scene had<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>not been a surprise
attack, but merely an early breakfast, which the suspicious Jew has made into a
too-early one, I would regard the girl's hair style as a product of art. Why is
it that an unruly coiffure suits a pretty face so much better than one from
which the scaffolding has just been removed? The source of this charm must lie
very deep and be rooted in human nature. For even the humblest members of the
female sex feel that it is at least more to their advantage to shake the hair
sometimes off the face, than to pin it neatly back. The Roman ladies felt that
long ago. Indeed, what did they not feel? </p>
