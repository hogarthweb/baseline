Plate 2<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In Plate
II, <a href="harlot.htm">Moll</a> is the kept mistress of a <a href="man1.htm">wealthy
lover</a>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She greets her newly-arrived
patron, while her <a href="woman.htm">maid</a> sneaks her <a href="man2.htm">preferred
lover</a>, in a state of undress out of the chamber.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll kicks over a table to create a diversion
so that the escape can be accomplished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lichtenberg comments that Moll’s <a href="monkey.htm">pet monkey</a>,
gasping in horror, witnesses the “danger” of the scene (21).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>What is
the “displayed” in displayed in the plate?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is it Moll’s absolute control over the situation?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has one lover for wealth and another,
presumably for sexual pleasure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mere
implication that Moll acknowledges, much less indulges in, sexual appetites
would be frightening to the English of Hogarth’s era.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A.D. Harvey notes that female sexual desire
was constructed as abnormal in the century:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The
corollary of the belief that normal women did not enjoy sex was that women who
enjoyed sex were not normal, and the term <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nymphomania</i>
came into use to describe the medical disorder that they were suffering from.
(44)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Moll’s
amused and satisfied expression certainly indicates her enjoyment of the sexual
pleasure provides by her lover, whose phallic, unsheathed sword leaves no doubt
(at least symbolically) as to their interrupted activity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She also enjoys her role as temptress in this
exotic, Edenic setting, using her appeal to lure her lovers into sin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <a href="brokenchina.htm">falling table</a>
(initiated by her “misstep”) not only foreshadows her fall but also recalls the
Fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>Paulson
also notes the escaping lover’s sword is placed so that it appears to stab
Moll’s Jewish lover in the back (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Life </i>vol.
1 256).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This enhances Hogarth’s
presentation of his harlot as dangerous and powerful.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like Helen of Troy, she has the power to
initiate violence between the rivals for her affection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This control over men is achieved solely
through sexuality, allowing her to rule through passion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This prospect is dangerous indeed in an era
that prized reason so highly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll’s
power is disorder, an overthrow of human rationality through animalistic
desire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Seduced by the glitter of a life of
wealth and comfort, <a href="harlot.htm">Moll</a> has fallen quickly from the
hands of the procuress and nobleman into the keeping of an unattractive but
wealthy <a href="man1.htm">Jewish businessman</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quite transformed by her experience, she apes
the life style of the class to which she aspires; instead of her modest work
clothes she wears silk stockings, stylish shoes and a fashionable dress that
reveals her arms and her breast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her
face, which bears a look of spirited insolence, is adorned with a beauty spot
that may hide the first signs of venereal disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her
apartment is richly appointed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She keeps
a <a href="woman.htm">maid</a> (dressed much as she herself was in Plate I), an
exotic <a href="boy.htm">West Indian servant boy</a> and a <a href="monkey.htm">monkey</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The monkey, the most pointed indication of
her affectation, resembles the merchant in facial expression and posture, and
there is little difference in her treatment of either plaything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prominent on her dressing table is a mirror,
symbol of vanity, beside it a jar of makeup and a smiling white mask.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mask, which is not unlike a death mask,
suggests that Moll has been taken to a masquerade by her partially but
fashionably dressed <a href="man2.htm">visitor</a>, a fellow noticeably more
youthful and attractive than the middle-aged businessman who supports her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Behind her
hang small portraits of two contemporaries held to be atheists, <a
href="picture1.htm">Samuel Clarke and Thomas Woolston</a>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Above the whole scene are two large
paintings, one of <a href="picture3.htm">Jonah outside Nineveh</a> seated next
to an ivy plant, the other of <a href="picture4.htm">David dancing before the
Ark</a> while Uzzah, attempting to touch it, is knifed in the back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The picture of Jonah may be a warning to heed
the prophet’s message to reform.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
painting of David and Uzzah, one of whom is killed for his sacrilege. the other
rebuked by his wife for indecency, seems to foreshadow the fates that await the
two characters in the scene (19).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>By Plate 2 she has become the
mistress of a <a href="man1.htm">rich Jew</a>, a sure sign of success: 'I
madam', boasts Gay's whore Slammekin in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Beggar's Opera</i>, 'was once kept by a Jew; and bating their religion, to
women they are a good sort of people.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But <a href="harlot.htm">Moll</a> snaps her fingers at good luck, and is
already deceiving him. As he takes tea, a <a href="man2.htm">young lover</a>
creeps out, trousers undone, the <a href="woman.htm">startled maid</a>
clutching his shoes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moll provides a
distraction, flashing her eyes and baring a nipple, flicking her fingers and
kicking her tea table, much to the alarm of the scalded Jew, the <a
href="monkey.htm">pet monkey</a> trailing her bonnet and the little <a
href="boy.htm">black slave</a> bringing the tea kettle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She seems in control, but she too is a slave
and a pet, ministering to a rich man’s desires (201-202).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The Jew's room . . . is decorated
not only with those portraits of <a href="picture1.htm">Woolston and Clarke</a>,
attacked as enemies of Christianity, but with two pictures of Old Testament history.
Appropriate, of course, but their content is mocking. In one, entitled <a
href="picture3.htm">'Jonah, why art thou angry?'</a>, a weeping Jonah rages
because God has not destroyed Nineveh (the Gentiles) as he promised. In the
other <a href="picture4.htm">David dances</a> with his harp, while Uzzah
steadies the Ark, toppled by the oxen: for this sacrilegious act, God, through
his priest, stabs him in the back. In the 'real' scene, where the Jew who has
'sacrilegiously' touched a Christian girl is balancing the tilting table with
his hand as Uzzah does the ark, the lover's sword also seems to 'stab him in
the back'. <span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Both pictures undermine the Jew,
presenting him as vengeful and tainted, but both also criticize the harshness
of Old Testament justice and the cruelty of religious zeal. The Jew (like Moll)
is an outsider and a victim of prejudice (204).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:teal'>Paulson,
Ronald. <i>Popular and Polite Art in the Age of Hogarth</i>. (1979)</span></b><a
name=PaulsonPPA></a><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:teal'> <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In the second plate, a painting on
the wall shows <a href="picture4.htm">Uzzah trying to steady the ark of the
covenant</a>, which is falling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
Uzzah is breaking the law, for he is not a Levite, and only Levites can touch
the ark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the biblical text he is
struck dead by an angry Jehovah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth
characteristically, omits the hand of God and substitutes a human priest, a
keeper of Jehovah’s law, who is stabbing Uzzah in the back. . . . From all of
his prints and paintings it is plain that Hogarth associates the law with the
Old Testament, the Ten Commandments, and the harshness of eye-for-an-eye
justice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Old Testament subjects appear
enclosed and forbidding as pictures on the wall, painted copies and after dead
masters, serving to urge on the living to brutal punishments for the least transgression
to themselves (19).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In the second plate of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A Harlot’s Progress</i> the <a href="mask.htm">mask</a>, <a
href="monkey.htm">monkey</a>, and mirror are straight out of Ripa’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Iconologia, </i>where the description of
Imitation includes “a woman holding a bundle of brushes in her right hand, a
mask in her left, with an ape at her feet.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The ape is present, Ripa says (1709 translation), because of “its
aptitude for imitating man with its gestures” (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ars simia naturae</i>), and the mask to suggest “the imitation, on and
off the stage, of the appearance and bearing of various characters.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Certainly “aping” and “masking,” verbally and
metaphorically, are present in the scene.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the level of story, the mask also alluded to a masquerade as the
place where the Harlot has met her new lover: she has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>worn</i> this mask, and so the metaphorical relationship is almost one
of identity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The monkey too is a
fashionable acquisition (like the <a href="boy.htm">black slave-boy</a>) which
has been made either by the <a href="man1.htm">Jewish merchant</a> or by his <a
href="harlot.htm">mistress</a>, and is itself an aping of fashion, which
applies to both: she with her clothes and <a href="man2.htm">young lover</a>, a
“lady”; he with his old-master paintings and Christian mistress, a
“gentleman.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The monkey is shown trying
on attire that resembles the Harlot’s before a dressing table, and his
expression of surprise at her <a href="brokenchina.htm">kicking over a table</a>
(to divert her keeper from the retreat of her lover) is parallel to the Jew’s
(118-119).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The two
examples of divine justice, pictured above the Harlot’s head on the wall of her
Jewish keeper’s room (or the one he has furnished for her), choose the moment
when God has withdrawn and spared <a href="picture3.htm">Nineveh</a> and it is
Jonah who is still cursing the wicked city; and in the story of Uzzah touching
the Ark of the Covenant, it is not God’s thunderbolt but a human priest who
stabs Uzzah in the back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The allegory
has been humanized, and the providential structure removed, or rather displaced
to human agents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On the one
hand, the order of divine providence has been reduced to the natural law of
causality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has been dismissed by the
humans themselves insofar as they ordered the mutilated copies of the
paintings. . . . While Hogarth demonstrates horizontal causality, however, he
also shows the vestiges of vertical causality, which should be the divine
pattern, but now consists only of humans imitating the models or the roles of
the biblical stories and classical myths, and the vertical pull is that of
puppet strings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When a priest stabs
Uzzah and Jonah curses the sinners of Nineveh, beneath the picture the Jewish
keeper prepares to curse the unfaithful Harlot and cast her into outer darkness
(119-120).</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#375FFB'>Paulson,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>. . . in the second plate, the <a
href="monkey.htm">monkey’s expression</a> paralleling the <a href="man1.htm">man’s</a>
as the girl—now <a href="harlot.htm">Harlot</a>—kicks over the <a
href="brokenchina.htm">tea table</a> in order to divert his attention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has been corrupted, as Pamela never is;
and there is no suggestion of Pamela’s devout purity (“May I never survive, one
moment, that fatal one in which I shall forfeit my innocence!”) or Clarissa’s
gloom (measuring herself for her coffin after being raped).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rather, she appears with her keeper, a <a
href="man1.htm">Jewish city merchant</a>, gaily distracting him in order to
allow a younger and more <a href="man2.htm">handsome lover</a> to sneak out the
door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
paintings that hang on the Jew’s wall—old master renderings of Old Testament
subjects—act as a commentary on their collector and his newest item.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Directly over his head is Uzzah rashly
touching the <a href="picture4.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a>, much as the
merchant took the forbidden object, a Christian girl: the Ark was supposed to
be carried only by Levites and Uzzah was not a Levite.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The whole scene below is a redaction of the
painting with imaginary lines connecting each character with his biblical
counterpart above.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most obvious, the
tilting Ark of the Covenant becomes the tilting tea table; Uzzah reaching out
to steady the Ark becomes the Jew steadying the table; the sportive oxen (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lasciviens</i> in the Biblical commentaries)
who cause the Ark to tile become the Harlot who locks over the table.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth has changed the story in 2 Samuel in
one respect: he has substituted for the hand of God a priest who is stabbing
Uzzah in the back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Harlot, like the
oxen, is kicking at her traces; she has taken a young lover, and toward the
door, appears (by a characteristically Hogarthian false perspective) to be
stabbing the Jew in the back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
stabbing priest becomes the cuckolding young lover. (Antlers appear prominently
in the pattern of the wallpaper.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The other
painting shows <a href="picture3.htm">Jonah sitting next to a withered gourd</a>
with God’s sun beating down on his head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>God was punishing Jonah for wanting the people of Nineveh to be
destroyed even after they had repented of their sins.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As Jonah sat outside the city walls hoping to
see the Ninevites destroyed, God sent a gourd to protect his head from the rays
of the sun, and a worm to wither it so that he would feel the full force of the
heat; then He asked Jonah to compare the gourd to Nineveh as a lesson in
mercy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hogarth’s Jonah has his fists
clenched in anger and is looking in the direction of Uzzah in the other
painting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether Jonah is analogous to
justice directed against the Jew or analogous to the Jew himself, the problem
is one of human justice and divine mercy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For if the Jew is a victim of human justice, he is also an agent of it:
like Jonah, he will pass rigorous judgment and banish the Harlot when he
discovers her transgression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paintings
he collects reflect his own stern Old Testament justice; in the next plate he
has past her out and she is living in a shabby room in Drury Lane, the
territory of prostitutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Moving up
into the print from the bottom left, from monkey to Jew, from tilting table to
Harlot, and thence up to the pictures, the painting of Uzzah reads as an
extension of the action below, and the painting of Jonah as a commentary on the
action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if (following the early
Hogarth commentators from Lichtenberg on) the paintings are read from left to
right, they apply equally well to the Harlot, who is under the protection of
the Jew as Jonah was under the shade of the gourd, which withered in the
morning leaving him unprotected under a fierce retributory sun.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The painting of Uzzah also applies in a way
to the Harlot, for like her Jewish keeper she too is reaching out to touch
something forbidden.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their situations
are in a way parallel: both are climbing socially, he by picture collecting and
taking a Christian girl for his mistress (I suppose this was the reason for
Hogarth’s making him a Jew), she by presuming to rise above the status of a
mistress and take a lover of her own; and both suffer particularly human
punishments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uzzah’s error, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>temeritas</i> or rashness, glossed by some
of the biblical commentators as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ignorantia,
</i>is her crime too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In her case the
materialization of God’s wrath in a priest connects with Justice Gonson in the
next plate, in which the distinction between human justice and divine mercy is
further underlined (vol. 1 255-256).</p>

sits under the shelter of her gourd, which sprang up in the night and which is
being destroyed by the worm in the morning; the painting is a parable of
&quot;the girl’s upstart grandeur, and the frail nature of her protection&quot;

</span>Both pictures imply the stern Old Testament justice that Moll can expect
from the Jew when he discovers her duplicity It is probable that Hogarth intended
to equate the Jew with David, singing, dancing, and playing his harp as he
enters Jerusalem in triumph with the Ark (this Christian girl). David,
&quot;who uncovered himself ... in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants,
as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself&quot; (2 <i

window.) Hogarth may have had in mind Tom Brown's &quot;Letter to Madame

about such a liaison (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Letters on Several

seated, is she not the living image of mobility? A whippet like a china
ornament, poised rather than standing upon its three little legs, and the
energy which it cannot expend on running is expressed at least by trembling;
ever divided between Heaven and Earth. And her face! Is that caricature? Do you
really think so? Ah, my good Hogarth, they still call you—you the painter of
souls—a caricaturist, but take comfort. Those who so mistake you are very
commonplace people. How to scrape laboriously together from little pots of
paint a Greek stone-face with blind eyeballs cribbed from some concealed
original, that you understand just as well as they did, and as well as hundreds
of your countrymen all of whom are forgotten, whereas you live on, and always
will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>I
have drawn attention to the face. To understand it thoroughly we must now
explain the whole scene, in rough outline first and then in detail. The girl is
the mistress of this Israelite who has rented a room for her far away from his
office and, perhaps, from his honest wife, where he can visit her at his
convenience, at any hour of the day, counting the day as twenty-four hours.
This morning he has driven up for breakfast. He must have come by coach, for
such a wig, such coat sleeves, and such a chapeau has the London urchins of the
New Testament would certainly not have tolerated in a pedestrian. Anyone
parading on foot through London like that exposes himself as if in the Pillory,
especially in the busy part of the City. But the deceived deceiver comes too
soon. Payment on sight, if not demanded, was at least expected, and so this
presentation ends with a protest. The funds are in an awful state. The <a
href="man2.htm">lover</a> with whom we spent the night is still on the premises
and must first be disposed of before we can undertake even to speak of payment.
There he slinks away at the back, only just not without his trousers, towards
the door which, as fate would have it, opens on the wrong side, under the
protection of the chamber-maid, who, to judge by her expression, has not had
much experience yet of such a situation. To cover this retreat (an art which
the greatest strategists have considered twice as difficult as achieving a
victory) Molly fires off all her guns, and even explodes a mine. She has
evidently led the discussion into the region of debt and credit, and at the
moment when the Jew reaches the undermined spot, the mine explodes, she lifts
her right leg and overturns the silver table with tea-pot and cups and
everything that was on it, and throws it all down topsy-turvy. Everything
jingles and clatters and crashes; even the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zona
torrida,</i> the Moor, trembles and stands petrified, while his compatriot, the
<a href="monkey.htm">monkey,</a> makes off. Only imagine what will happen when
the table falls, and fall it certainly will! No Homeric shield, when its bearer
fell, ever made such a crash as that upon the Trojan heath. And so the retreat
is covered, and the lover has escaped from the Portuguese sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Now for the little face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Greater impertinence in the eyes of a girl still in her
teens, greater familiarity with all the practices of harlotry, combined with the
knowledge of a still greater unused stock in reserve, could hardly be better
expressed in so few strokes. In the whole face no line and no contrasting
shadow, and yet how eloquent! 'See, fellow, not so much do I care for you and
your wretched plunder; a fig for it!', and with a snap of her finger she
indicates exactly how much she thinks of the plunder. It is half a finger joint
and a little sound that she brings to his notice. The right eye has something
indescribably scornful. But the fellow has money and that is an important item
which the left eye clearly recognizes. The feint is, I think, quite
unmistakable. On her whole right wing, war is declared, while the left is at
peace, or at least, some admission is made there of guilt. On the right wing the
knee is raised at least a few hands above the line of modesty, and in an ugly
way, so that the tip of the foot is turned inwards; and the arm stretched out
so that in the Quart she brings the snap of her fingers as close beneath the
enemy's nose as if it were a pinch of snuff. The bracelet is missing. Where
could it have been left last night? I have searched the departing lover for it
more than once, but in vain. The upper part of the body leans over to support
the lunge with its weight, and the head is drawn back to support it with
contempt. The bosom presses forward, not as an offensive measure, of course,
but the impertinence of the right side is palpably increased thereby. I have
also read somewhere that a besieged enemy was once harassed, not only by cannon
balls, but also in a most grievous manner by roast geese and wheaten bread
which were displayed to him on a turnspit from afar. It is said that this form
of attack was much more painful than the other because there was nothing with
which to counter it, and every shot was a hit. On the left flank all is much
more compliant, even the pretty arm speaks only of affability. I have seen them
sometimes like that, when there was no enemy about, but merely an innocent
neighbour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We still cannot get away from that little head. If the
whole scene had<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>not been a surprise
attack, but merely an early breakfast, which the suspicious Jew has made into a
too-early one, I would regard the girl's hair style as a product of art. Why is
it that an unruly coiffure suits a pretty face so much better than one from
which the scaffolding has just been removed? The source of this charm must lie
very deep and be rooted in human nature. For even the humblest members of the
female sex feel that it is at least more to their advantage to shake the hair
sometimes off the face, than to pin it neatly back. The Roman ladies felt that
long ago. Indeed, what did they not feel? </p>

English gardens ruins are newly erected to improve the scenery. There they are
meant to evoke meditations on the vanity of all human beauty and greatness,
with the passage of the centuries. Here the momentary effect is also
chronological, but points only to the possibility of a mysterious destruction
in one night. It must appear, however, that such pre-arrangement was highly
unlikely, otherwise everything is lost and the warmest enthusiasm congeals at
the sight of an unlovely, cold, hair-dresser's model. I feel the utmost pity
for the good young wives who have announced in the newspapers their decision
not to mourn for their—dear —husbands (this is not a question of spirit and
truth, but only weeds and black). For Heaven's sake and your own, take back
that vow! Otherwise it may not come true. Weeds and black on young widows have
always been regarded as a sort of solemn illumination of the burnt down part of
a beautiful building, of which just the finest wing has remained standing, and
who would not, thinks everyone, try to save the best and most beautiful in a
conflagration? If they cease to mourn, nobody will feel sorry for them any
longer, and all the great arrangements in the world for catching and letting
oneself be caught will lose their force, and young widows dwindle down to mere

not advantageous to the ruins. So much for charming—ruins. <span

language to describe what Molly's mouth is saying or has said. Only musical
notes could do that in a range of at least four octaves. She has absolutely no
ear, as on all such occasions. Instead her mouth has become
two-tongued—Bilinguis—Billings—Billings-gate—Billingsgate- language. Ten
invectives a second with a snap of the fingers to beat time. Save us!—and
protect us! from such a storm and such porcelain hail-stones! How does the Jew
comport himself? He accompanies the four-octave descant of his beauty in deep,
slow, nasal bass, and he is well advised to do so. The first violin would burst
if he had responded in still faster rhythm. He does not care to risk that. He
has her on a life-and-love annuity. The interest, of course, for this morning,
has gone, but the capital must be preserved. If anyone cannot follow the
meaning of Kleist's </p>

would be well advised to listen to that mouth and its neighbour, the
reverberating nose, and he will surely see what sound they make. All is terror,
astonishment, and apprehension in that noble head. His not very closely cropped
hair seems to stand on end under its artificial load, so that Cupid wins time
to push forward a little wisp of oriental hue over his brow which could not be
more charming. Hesternam credos. The poor fellow! One really cannot look at him
without smiling. For terror itself becomes ridiculous if its cause is the loss
of unlicensed goods or forbidden fruit; and this is the case here. How
mechanically he grips with all five fingers (it might very well have been six),
upon one of which visibly rests Ephraim's blessing. I mean, a Berlin
jeweller's. What he wants to catch hold of is silver, but the table will surely
fall, because it cannot put a leg forward like its owner, who through this
prerogative of all living things is by means of his legs only just able to keep
himself in his seat. A solitary teacup is also saved, being perilously balanced
in his right hand. But the others! One can hardly bear to look at it. Confusion
and distress on every side. Everything is taking flight before the raised knee
and tries to save itself. The sugar bowl and the little dish, and what appears
to be a milk jug, venture first to spring overboard—and are no more! A little
lid jumps after them and while still in the air sees the same fate approaching.
Another lid appears to make a running start upon deck so as to jump over the
others—with a like result. Calmest of all seems the teapot. Before risking the
fatal jump it rids itself not only of its lid, which it has thrown a good way
in advance, but also of its boiling ballast, and that straight into its
master's stockings, and thence still farther, into his shoes. To judge from the
hasty flight of the lid, and because this way of softening human skin is rather
slow, the pot is going to turn topsy-turvy before it has finished, to
accelerate the process. If one could reason with teapots, I know what I should
tell this one—'This,' I would say, 'was a perfidious prank of yours, and the
more perfidious the more it looks like a Last Will. Provided you get away
without complete destruction, take care that as a reward for your pranks you do
not become a badly glued-together, or even a mutilated laughing-stock, for the
servants, in all your future services.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>That what the girl has just said must have been far
weightier than what she indicates with her finger tips, may be seen from the
petrifaction of the man, from which even the boiling tea, served at the utterly
unsuitable end, is not capable of rousing him. Hogarth has done all that very
well. For indeed, if he has not made us feel that, we should not hear either
the creaking of the door, or the footsteps of the sly and lucky rival who even
has his shoes carried after him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The Europeans in this picture seem to pay little attention
to the clatter of the <a href="brokenchina.htm">falling tea-table</a> with all
its appurtenances. Three of them are not losing anything by it, and the fourth
ignores it because he is losing so much. All the stronger, however, do the two
directing gods of love from the torrid zone, monkey and Moor, feel the sad
movements of the two hearts which they keep in trust, and which are now at
variance. Looking at the monkey beside a pair of lovers like that, it is almost
impossible not to think of him with bow and arrow. He is in flight, the poor
devil; just now he was playing peacefully with mother's cap, just as in former
days the Greek ideal whom he is aping disported himself with the helmet of
Mars, when he came to mother with fatherly intentions. And now the swarthy god
of love! His woolly hair seems to stand on end. Perhaps while sorrowing over
the fate of his West Indian brothers, he sees with horror that here too he will
have to—clear up the mess. The figure is striking and the expression has become
almost proverbial. Garrick, whose stature tended more to the graceful than the
majestic type, and whose whole soul found expression above all in his face,
once undertook to act the part of Shakespeare's Moor of Venice, the strong,
passionate and thundering Othello, a part which the most versatile soul could
not have acted without physical weight. The consequence was that every make-up
he put on was a failure, and especially that of the chimney sweep, which simply
made night out of his day. When he appeared thus, Quinn, a comic actor of the
first rank, notorious for his loose, biting humour, called out: 'Here's
Pompey,—where's the tea-kettle?' Only once more, it is said, did Garrick ever
dare to appear in that role, and then never again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The escaping lover we shall allow to escape. To look at
him is enough; it needs no comment. Only a single incidental remark on the
sentimental side of his appointment. There is no Cupid to be seen fluttering
over that Adonis to cover his retreat with delicate wings and in the end smile
contemptuously back into the room. Instead, and this is far safer, he has
cudgel and rapier under his arm. Whoever creeps into such a hen-house must
always expect that the first person he meets will be just such another cock.
One cannot miss the cockade on his hat. Thus he was here merely on duty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Immediately
in front of the monkey stands a toilet table, and his flight is evidently
directed thither. He wants to crawl underneath where at least he will no longer
see the danger, and this, as is well known, is as good as security itself for
monkeys and children and whatever else belongs to that category. A mirror
stands on the table, and a little packet of visiting cards and a <a
href="mask.htm">mask</a> are lying there. Perhaps Molly returned last night
from a Masked Ball and brought with her the new recruit who is about to desert
in the background. What lies in the right-hand corner there looks very much
like a discarded domino. To be sure there could be no greater warning against
masquerades, at least the London ones. Hussies like her brought together with
honest people into one and the same game on a perfectly equal footing merely
through a flimsy disguise!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing good
can come from that. We all hope for equality in the next world. To look for it
here already is dangerous in any case, and especially in a domino; for it does
not always cease when the mask is thrown down, and upon such a cessation
depends after all the whole charm of the short illusion. <span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>On the back wall hang two pictures, which may even be
woven into the tapestry, for the comer of one of them is under the frame of the
door. However, strict perspective was never Hogarth's strong point. The one
nearest the door represents the prophet <a href="picture3.htm">Jonah facing the
city of Nineveh</a>, and as if boxing with a cluster of sunrays which the
worm-eaten watermelon is no longer capable of warding off. Such fists have the
weight of words in England. The other represents <a href="picture4.htm">King
David</a>, not in his glory, but when he dances before the Ark of the Covenant
and is despised by Micah, Saul's daughter, who looks out of a window. The Ark
of the Covenant is drawn by oxen who upset it, as it is written in the Bible,
and the Ark falls, or is about to fall. A certain Uzzah tries to support it,
and for that service a man in a Bishop's mitre runs a knife into his breast,
from behind. The Bible only says, 'and the anger of the Lord was kindled
against Uzzah, and he smote him for his error and there he died by the Ark of
God'. I am sorry to find that Hogarth wants to interpret the ancient Bible in a
modern way. Take care, good friend, I thought to myself, there you are upon the
dangerous bridge which is to connect Sunday faith with weekday reason! Of what
avail are your pictures against folios of which you do not understand a
syllable, and which, had they ever so little force would still remain
respectable through their mass alone. Take care! Though nobody is likely to
murder you from behind, as they did your Uzzah before the Ark of God, but I
don't mind betting that before you know where you are something very hot may be
poured into your shoes, as happened to our Jew at the tea-table. 'Stick to your
last' is a proverb upon which the earth itself rests. It is this true saying
which restrains us here and compels us to pass over the second picture
completely. Since the interpretation of straightforward prophecies of even the
minor prophets offers Such difficulties to the most profound scholars, how much
more difficult is it for an insignificant writer to interpret the artificial
misuse which a sly fox makes of them. One word only on the subject: Jonah
complains about a misfortune which has not materialized, and is afraid of
sunstroke. Here too there is at least an indication that the two diamonds in
the Jew's head might blaze up and prove deadly; a misfortune which though
conjectured by almost every reader does not materialize either. No more now
about these pictures, though a more courageous interpreter could and would
perhaps say more. If anyone would like to venture an interpretation of his own
he may look up the fourth Chapter of the prophet Jonah and 2 Samuel, Chapter 6.
On the same wall hang two engravings of characters from the New Testament, with
wigs and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chapeau-bas;</i> thus scholars.
In the first copies of the engraving the higher one was a portrait of the
famous Dr Clark, and the one beneath of Mr Woolston. The latter has written an
apologia for the Christian religion against the Jews, and the former on a
number of topics which would here provide more material for conjecture. This
must, however, be left undone because Hogarth by eradicating their names in
later copies has expressly shown his wish that it should be left undone
(16-24). </p>
