  <p><b><font color="#FF8000">Shesgreen:</font></b> Their spiritual leader, the 
    clergyman (identified by Hogarth as &quot;the famous Couple-Beggar in The 
    Fleet&quot;), who is supposed to give a religious tone to the event, has his 
    hand up the skirt of the girl beside him. His venereal preoccupation causes 
    him to spill. The fact of the girl who covers his exploring hand with a mourning 
    hat is filled with a look of dreamy satisfaction (23).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works</i>:</font></b><font color="#8000FF"> 
    </font>The ribbons on his [Moll's son] and the parson's hats are weepers.</p>
  <p>The parson is using his hat to conceal what his right hand is up to, but 
    in his concentration he spills his Nantz (brandy).</p>
  <p>In the copy published by Bowles the parson is labeled 'A' and is explained 
    as 'The famous Couple-Beggar in The Fleet, a wretch who there screens himself 
    from the justice due to his villainies, and daily repeats them'-i.e. he celebrates 
    clandestine or irregular marriages. He has also been identified as 'Orator' 
    Henley, but so has ever disreputable person in Hogarth's oeuvre (and this 
    parson resembles Henley much less than the parson in Midnight Modern Conversation, 
    Plate 134). The woman with whom he dallies has been tenuously connected with 
    Elizabeth Adams, who was hanged in January 1737/38 (149).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800080">Uglow:</font></b> The clergyman, spilling his brandy, 
    has his hand up the skirt of a demure-looking woman who coyly hides his gropings 
    with her hat (209).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Dobson:</font></b><font color="#FF0000"> </font>the 
    clergymman (!) of Plate VI is identified with a certain disreputable Fleet 
    chaplain, and the shrieking beldam with a procuress named Bentley (35).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#314F44">Quennell:</font> </b>The clergyman, who will conduct 
    the funeral,, so the portrait of a &quot;Fleet Chaplain,&quot; a shady cleric 
    established in the purlieus the gaol, who earned his keep by the celebration 
    of clandestine or irregular weddings, A soft, slippery, sheep-faced man, whose 
    dull prominent eyes, which goggle straight ahead, are beginning to brim over 
    with a vague concupiscence, he spills his flask of gin into his lap, while 
    his fingers make tentative explorations among his neighbour's petticoats. 
    She does not repulse, but pretends to ignore his sally, attempting, however, 
    to conceal it behind the wide brim of his mourning-hat (100).</p>

    The depraved priest does not seem likely to feel for the dead that hope expressed 
    in our liturgy (118).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> </b>The man beside her is not 
    a clergyman. We beg our readers most earnestly not to entertain such a thought; 
    anything like that would necessarily be prejudicial to the artist, and thereby 
    the whole impression which this piece should make would be lost. There is 
    merely a clergyman's frock. The thing inside it here is one of the few eminent 
    scoundrels to whom Hogarth has justly accorded an infamous immortality; a 
    Charters in his way. Would not the artist have done better, someone might 
    ask, had he spared the cloth here as well? We regard that remark as very well 
    founded; indeed, we are even convinced that it would have been better. But 
    since that is how matters stand, we must hear the artist's defence as well. 
    We undertake it with genuine pleasure and in the sure hope that he will be 
    acquitted.</p>

<p>In his works Hogarth has made attacks on three occasions upon people in
parsons' clothes, that is true;<sup> </sup>but that he ever attacked the
profession of clergyman as such, we cannot recall. Out of these three, two are
portraits of well-known people, about whose despicable character the voice of
the public had already decided long before Hogarth voiced his opinion. He has
thus done nothing but what every honest man had done before him, except that he
drew and painted where others spoke or wrote. Whether the picture of the third
is also a portrait, we cannot say with certainty, but it would still show no
disparagement of an honourable calling if it were not. The fellow is only a bit
of a gourmand, and on an occasion which regularly occurs but every seventh
year. Apart from this he does not hide his doings in a corner, but makes his
feast, so to speak, right in the lap of his constituency, before the eyes of
his flock, who feast together with him, and it does not cost his family a
penny. Such conduct can hardly be called reprehensible. But here, here the
situation defies description. Hogarth certainly felt this very keenly. He
therefore did something which he had never done in any of his works, so far as we
know; something which is hardly compatible with his manner of satire (though in
order to exonerate oneself completely, even such extraordinary methods may be
necessary). On the 1,200 copies for subscribers, he marked that vile creature
with a capital 'A' which referred to a footnote under the Plate where it is
clearly stated who he was, and where and how he managed to escape the law. Now
just imagine what a lawless creature that abomination must have been, when an
honest, well-known and well-esteemed man like Hogarth does not scruple to draw
him thus for all the world to see, and, in addition, virtually invokes justice
against him. In this way, or so it seems to us, he has not only proved that he
did not intend to attack the clergy's estate, but on the contrary, he has shown
how much he had its honour at heart. When hunting out subjects for satire, an
occupation which he tirelessly pursued, many an object that knew how to evade
the activity of the police and the law fell into his snare, and he acted rightly
in delivering them up to the authorities, or, if the authorities let them
escape again through carelessness, in giving them at the next opportunity the <i>coup
de grâce </i>himself.</p>

<p>This scoundrel, evidently the Spadille<sup> </sup>among the trumps in
hearts, as the other black ace, the Undertaker, is the Basta, was so well known
under the name Couple-Beggar (because he copulated for a few pence) that
Hogarth's interpreters have forgotten his proper name, a feature which in
itself speaks for his great eminence in the profession. We have been assured
that, apart from that other occupation, he united himself regulariter a couple
of times a week-with the gutter. Not only symbolically, as the Doge of Venice
marries the <st1:place>Adriatic</st1:place>. Instead of throwing a trifle into
it, he threw in everything which he still had left in the evening--himself. A
Divine he has never been called, he was merely an adept at holding Divine
Services, and even there he Just babbled through the Marriage and Funeral
service-for a few pence. His spiritual hand, as it was called, never fished for
more, but fished all the more often-while his worldly hand demanded stole-fees
wherever they could be found, in pockets with and without bottom <i>ad
infinitum. </i>This is well known. Whether Hogarth tried to hint at something of
this sort here cannot well be decided. In his so-called spiritual hand, the
left one, he holds the funeral brandy very badly and stains his handkerchief
with it. Where the worldly one is, nobody, so far as we know, has yet been able
to decide. People have looked for it under Couple-Beggar's hat, which the
Manille<sup> </sup>is holding very carefully in front of it, but it has not
been found there either. We therefore willingly abandon this <i>locum
difficillimum </i>and pass over with genuine pleasure, in the way of commentators,
to an easier one--to Snub- nose. She stands at the foot of her friend's coffin
with a mortar in her hand, like a female sutler before the inn counter. I call
that feeling! And yet, to the honour of human nature, there is in her wild look
a kind of unmistakable disapproval at the behaviour of the neighbouring couple.
It absorbs, as one can see, her whole attention, and although her mouth speaks
of much latitude in such matters, yet her eye seems to find place and time and
hour somewhat unbecoming. It is a fine touch of Hogarth's to put even into that
unfeeling tiger-face an expression of disapproval at such bestiality, and thus
to make even the stones cry out about it. In passing we would beg our readers
to recall for themselves what that creature has done and suffered so far, and
what sort of a life that is, and yet even as we read this, it is still lived by
countless women! But we do not wish to prejudice the views to which this might
give occasion about the inheritors of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Kingdom</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Heaven</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and their spiritual
guides! (74-76) </p>
