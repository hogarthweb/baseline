<p><b>Other commentary:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

  <p><b><font color="#FF8000">Shesgreen:</font></b> Before the coffin Moll's son, 
    decked out grandly as the principal mourner, plays with his spinning top (23). 
  </p>
  <p><b><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hogarth&#8217;s 
    Graphic Works</i>: </font></b>The chief mourner is the little boy, the Harlot's 
    son, with his large black felt hat edged in broad lace. The ribbons on his 
    and the parson's hats are weepers. The boy is unconcernedly winding up a peg-top 
    (or &quot;castle-top,&quot; as some of the versified descriptions of the print 
    call it) (149).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800080">Uglow: </font></b>The little boy, in full adult 
    gear, with lace around his black felt hat, examines his spinning-top oblivious 
    to the fuss, a study in absorbed concentration from his open mouth to his 
    feet, dangling down in their buckled shoes (209).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#314F44">Quennell:</font> </b>Near the sprigs of rosemary 
    arranged on a platter, the chief mourner sits swaddled in his weeds and, being 
    a philosophic and much-experienced child, devotes his attention to his brand-new 
    spinning top. Hogarth's sympathy with the characters of children clearly extended 
    to an appreciation of their intermittent callousness; or, rather, he would 
    seem to have understood what narrow and arbitrary limits confine their powers 
    of suffering. But at least the child's indifference is a form of innocence 
    . . .(99-100).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg: </font></b>Almost beneath the coffin, 
    just as formerly beside the death-chair, sits again the little heir, occupied 
    with a pain-alleviating instrument. There it was a chop which he turned on 
    the spit; here he winds a top which he is going to spin in the chamber of 
    mourning. It looks as if the anodyne had worked well on the little chap. However, 
    it may also be that what one takes for the cause here is really the effect. 
    The boy does not grieve, but not because he is roasting his meat and winding 
    his top, but he roasts and winds because he does not grieve. Why should he 
    fret? Just as he has no father, since nobody knew who he was, so he had no 
    mother either, because in the society where he lived nobody had time to be 
    one. Oh, the words father and mother mean very much more than we usually find 
    in their dictionary definitions, and more than people think when they read 
    them! Just as many a child whose true parents are far beyond the grave finds, 
    thank God!, a new father or a mother, so, alas! there are fatherless and motherless 
    orphans whose parents are thoroughly enjoying themselves day after day. Evidently 
    the poor fellow has often been pushed from one corner into another; but since 
    the decease there will be one pusher less. Even supposing that snub-nose will 
    sometimes throw him into the corner now, there is still nobody near at hand 
    to throw him back again. From the boy's puny legs we might almost conclude 
    that the anodyne necklaces have not been of much use. That Hogarth has dressed 
    the boy up as chief mourner is a mockery in more than one respect; children 
    are never used in that role; it must always be a man of some presence who 
    would not disgrace an afflicted heart. But the expression could also imply 
    ''the chief among the mourners', and in this way the situation becomes almost 
    ludicrous. For if the most deeply afflicted is winding his top shortly before 
    the cortège leaves, we can easily surmise how deeply afflicted the others 
    must be. The dish with rosemary as well as the little table with the gloves 
    and the glove-stretcher for the too-narrow fingers are plain enough, but the 
    position of the pair of gloves is perhaps not without intention. They seem 
    to have moved apart as if shocked, and so as to clasp each other again, and 
    to shame by their example at least ten pairs of hands of flesh and blood among 
    the thirteen which are assembled here and are occupied in a somewhat worldly 
    manner (77-78). </p>
