<p><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>In this last plate of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Harlot's Progress</i>, Moll <span
class=SpellE>Hackabout's</span> death is being &quot;mourned&quot; by an
unusually distracted collection of attendants. While some figures are dressed in
mourning, there seems no actual sadness for death. There is, however, a
difference here between what SEEMS and what IS. Two <a href="whisper.htm">women
in the background</a> appear to be crying, but their tears are more likely due
to the alcohol they are consuming than to actual grief. <a href="kid.htm">Moll's
son</a> in the foreground appears pensive and concentrated, but he is actually
busying himself with a toy. This dichotomy between appearance and reality
harkens back to <a href="../18/18screen.jpg">PLATE <span class=GramE>I </span></a>.
Here, a <a href="../18/bawd.htm">bawd welcomes</a> the newly arrived Moll to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>. Her touch, while seeming a
gentle caress accesses the merchandise. Furthermore, in both plates, she is
ignored by <a href="john.htm">clergymen</a>, who literally <a
href="../18/clergy.htm">turn their backs</a> on the situation. Our amorous man
of the cloth here fondles his female companion while his drink spills into his
lap in an ejaculatory fashion. While Paulson comments on the &quot;father&quot;
figure (that is, the clergyman's) there is also notably the mother, here Mother
Needham and her more active role in Moll's demise (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Life </i>vol. 1 253). The only dependable force in Moll's life, her
sister of sorts, is the <a href="crone.htm">syphilitic servant</a> who attends
her and who is the only true mourner in this concluding plate. This is a
dysfunctional family indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The <a href="slut.htm">clergyman's
companion</a> is another noteworthy figure. Her gaze, out of the plate and at
the viewer recalls <a href="../20/20screen.jpg">PLATE III</a> where <a
href="../20/moll.htm">Moll</a> gives us almost the same look. Commentators have
typically seen <a href="../20/20screen.jpg">PLATE III </a>as the point where
Moll's luck drastically reverses. Here, the <span class=SpellE>nightwatch</span>
is breaking in to search for her watch-thief highwayman lover. Her room's
decrepit condition is a distinct change from her more luxurious life as a kept
woman. However, there are remnants of Moll's power, ones that show she still
has considerable authority. First, she is literally ON TOP of her lover who is
hiding under the bed (as betrayed by the cat). The <a
href="../20/hatandtwigs.htm">hat and twigs</a> indicate not only a potential
preference for flagellation but hint at witchcraft, both of which demonstrate
female power. Moll attracts the gaze of the viewer, as does the woman in this
plate. So Moll's power does not die with her, and she and the <span
class=SpellE>foregrounded</span> woman become sisters in subversion--her power
over the clergyman is apparent. Another hint at this connection is the presence
of the twigs (here seen in the lady's hand and on the <a href="plate.htm">plate</a>).
Although commentators have alternately called the twigs yew branches and
rosemary, they are certainly reminders of branches in Moll's broom in <a
href="../20/20screen.jpg">PLATE <span class=GramE>III </span></a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>However, while these
objects and this gaze demonstrate a type of female power, it is a temporary and
transient one, one that does not originate with her, one she does not fully
possess and one that does not help her to evade her fate. In this series, death
has no real impact--nothing changes. There is no grand realization of the need
to change </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>'s corruption of innocent girls.
There is no grieving for the loss of life. There is simply persistence, of all
the elements from previous plate--thievery, vanity, lust, indulgence. The
forces of corruption that contributed to her downfall are still intact, even in
this funeral scene. Peter <span class=SpellE>Quennell</span> states, &quot;If <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> had a message to impart, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A Harlot's Progress</i>, at all events, it is not a message of a very
lofty kind. That vice seldom pays is the only conclusion we draw. Unlike
Defoe's more submissive heroines, Moll <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> does
not round off a life of indulgence by paying lip-service to the beauties of
virtue. So far as we can ascertain, she has never repented . . . Moll dies at
the age of 23 and it is the wastefulness rather than the intrinsic wickedness
that seems chiefly to have moved <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>&quot;
(102).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there seems to be no real
disdain for her either. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> condemnation, then,
is for the society that allows such things to happen--Moll is not an important
figure. If this were the case, the series could have ended with her death in <a
href="../22/22screen.jpg">PLATE <span class=GramE>V </span></a>, as Jenny <span
class=SpellE>Uglow</span> reports that many viewers desired (208-209). Instead,
here in the culminating plate, Moll is not visible. The coffin here is
downplayed; <span class=SpellE>Shesgreen</span> even comments that it is being
used as a bar (23). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The figure which catches
out eye most immediately is that of Moll's legacy, staring at us from the
plate. The central figure, <a href="kid.htm">Moll's son</a>, further
underscores the fact that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> is not specifically
blaming her. <span class=SpellE>Uglow</span> notes, &quot;One sign of <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> respect and compassion toward Moll in 'The
Harlot's Progress' is that she <a href="../22/son.htm">kept her child alive</a>,
and even when she herself was dying in squalor, her boy was fed and stoutly
clothed&quot; (326).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unlike the <span
class=SpellE>Sqanderfield</span> offspring from <i>Marriage a la Mode</i>, this
young boy shows no sign of the syphilis which killed his mother and has almost
certainly affected him. I see no real signs, then, in this series, and
especially not in this plate, that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> indicts
her as complicit in her own ruin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p>Moll, dead at the age of twenty-three, is being waked. The plate on her coffin 
    reads: &quot;M. <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> Died <span
class=SpellE>Sepr</span> 2d. <span class=GramE>1731 Aged 23.&quot;</span> Nobody 
    mourns her passing as the mock vigil held for her. Leading lives that are 
    without options, her sisters have little to learn from her death. Gathered 
    around her coffin, they exhibit a variety of contrasting attitudes toward 
    the occasion. Their spiritual leader, the <a href="john.htm">clergyman</a> 
    (identified by <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> as &quot;the famous Couple-Beggar 
    in The Fleet&quot;), who is supposed to give a religious tone to the event, 
    has his hand up the skirt of the girl beside him. His venereal preoccupation 
    causes him to spill. The fact of the <a href="slut.htm">girl</a> who covers 
    his exploring hand with a mourning hat is filled with a look of dreamy satisfaction.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Before the coffin <a
href="kid.htm">Moll’s son</a>, decked out grandly as the principal mourner, plays 
    with his spinning top. At the right side of the scene an <a
href="pray.htm">old woman</a>, probably Moll’s bawd, howls in a fit of tears inspired 
    as much by the brandy bottle at her side as by considerations of financial 
    loss. Behind the bawd, an <a href="hug.htm">undertaker</a> <span
class=SpellE>oversolicitiously</span> assists a girl with her glove she postures 
    as if in grief as she steals his handkerchief. At the <a
href="mirror.htm">mirror</a> a girl adjusts her headgear vainly, oblivious to 
    the prominent disease spot on her forehead. <a href="dance.htm">A weeping 
    figure</a> shows a disordered finger to a companion who seems more curious 
    than sympathetic.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><a href="lady1.htm">Only 
    one person</a> lifts back the coffin lid (which is being used as a bar) to 
    look in detached curiosity, rather than in grief or reflection, upon Moll’s 
    corpse. In the background two older women huddle together demonstratively 
    and drink. The only person with a sense of decorum is <a href="crone.htm">Moll’s 
    maid</a>, who glares angrily at the conduct of the parson and his mate. Above 
    the scene stands a <a href="wallhanging.htm">plaque</a> showing three faucets 
    with spigots in them, the ironic coat of arms of the company (23).</p>

  <p><b><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span></b>On the coffin-plate 
    is inscribed &quot;M. <span class=SpellE>Hakabout</span> Died <span
class=SpellE>Sepr</span> 2 1731 Aged <span class=GramE>23&quot;,</span> and a 
    mocking set of armorial bearings for the deceased hang on the back wall (needless 
    to say, such did not accompany the funerals of whores): &quot;<i>Azure, <span class=SpellE>parti</span> 
    per chevron, sable</i>, three <span
class=SpellE>fossets</span>, in which three <span class=SpellE>spiggots</span> 
    are inserted, all <i>proper</i>.&quot; Sprigs of yew appear on the coffin 
    lid and on the <a href="plate.htm">plate</a> at the parson’s feet, and the 
    <a
href="slut.htm">lady</a> beside the <a href="john.htm">parson</a> holds a sprig 
    of rosemary for remembrance. Both yew and rosemary were employed at funerals 
    because they were thought to prevent infection. The chief mourner is the <a
href="kid.htm">little boy</a>, the Harlot’s son, with his large black felt hat 
    edged in broad lace. The ribbons on his and the parson’s hats are weepers. 
    The boy is unconcernedly winding up a peg-top (or &quot;castle-top,&quot; 
    as some of the versified descriptions of the print call it). Only the <span
class=SpellE>noseless</span> servant woman shows any sincere sorrow, and she casually 
    uses the coffin lid as a table to set her glass on. The <a
href="lady1.htm">girl looking into the coffin</a> is doubtless regarding Moll 
    as <i>a <span class=SpellE>momento</span> <span class=SpellE>mori</span></i>. 
    <a
href="dance.htm">The woman behind her</a> is weeping because of her finger, which 
    appears to be diseased in some way. The parson is using his hat to conceal 
    what his right hand is up to, but in his concentration he spills his <span

    who handles the funeral, is making advances to a prostitute by the window.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the copy published by 
    Bowles the parson is labeled &quot;A&quot; and is explained as &quot;The famous 
    Couple-Beggar in The Fleet, a wretch who there screens himself from the justice 
    due to his villainies, and daily repeats them&quot;—i.e. he celebrates clandestine 
    or irregular marriages. He has also been identified as &quot;Orator&quot; 
    <st1:place>Henley</st1:place>, but so has ever disreputable person in <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> <i>oeuvre </i>(and this parson resembles Henley 
    much less than the parson in Midnight Modern Conversation, Plate 134). The 
    woman with whom he dallies has been tenuously connected with Elizabeth Adams, 
    who was hanged in January 1737/38. Some of the other characters have been 
    identified, but with no certainty and <span class=GramE>to</span> little purpose. 
    <a href="pray.htm">The woman at the far right</a>, according to <span
class=SpellE>Breval</span>, was &quot;Mother Bentley, a noted Bawd&quot;; and 
    since we know that the <span class=SpellE>noseless</span> woman is the servant 
    of earlier plates, the woman at the right must be Moll’s bawd. This explains 
    her passionate lamentation.</p>

    sense <span class=GramE>a naturalization</span> and reduction of sacred materials 
    to a joke –the refusal to see paradox? (19-20)</p>
  <p>But as a more purely visual pun, the sign (the bell from plate 1) anticipates 
    the <a href="wallhanging.htm">obscene coat of arms</a> of the Harlot that

    the series should end here [Plate 5], with Moll’s death, the wages of her 
    sin. But <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> bitter comedy insists that life 
    goes on, <span class=GramE>Like</span> a satirical afterpiece following a 
    tragedy, his last print shows the mourners before Moll’s funeral. Scene by 
    scene, from the open air of the <span class=SpellE>coachyard</span> <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    tracked his heroine’s increasing confinement down to her last tight space, 
    her coffin. One young woman looks at her face, hidden from us. Around this 
    gesture of pity and, perhaps identification, women stand in extravagant stage 
    poses of grief. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> marks the pompous rites 
    of death <span
class=SpellE>favoured</span> by this age, and by baroque art, by showing the indifferent 
    callousness of life. The erotic play continues to the end, and viewers (or 
    voyeurs) might laugh more than weep. The <a href="john.htm">clergyman</a>, 
    spilling his brandy, has his hand up the skirt of a <a href="slut.htm">demure-looking 
    woman</a> who coyly hides his <span class=SpellE>gropings</span> with her 
    hat. The smooching <a href="hug.htm">undertaker</a> helps a whore with her 
    funeral gloves, while she steals his handkerchief. The <a href="kid.htm">little 
    boy</a>, in full adult gear, with lace around his black felt hat, examines 
    his spinning-top oblivious to the fuss, a study in absorbed concentration 
    from his open mouth to his feet, dangling down in their buckled shoes. On 
    the far wall hangs the mother’s old country hat, next to a satirical-obscene 
    <a
href="wallhanging.htm">coat of arms</a> made up of three faucets, plugged with 
    spigots. On the floor in front of them al lies a <a href="plate.htm">dish</a>

    <span class=SpellE>Roquet</span> so closely as almost to quote his words. 
    The plate he <span class=GramE>says,</span> is &quot;the farce, of which, 
    death is, oftener, the occasion than the subject.&quot; That (as both imply) 
    <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>—like Goldsmith later—intended to <span
class=SpellE>satirise</span> the senseless funeral ceremonial of the day, and 
    that in doing so upon the present occasion he has somewhat strained consistency, 
    is true. But it is also true that he was wiser than his critics, and that 
    all this was merely subsidiary to a deeper and sterner lesson, more intimately 
    connected with the subject. What other epilogue, indeed, could there be to 
    such a life! Conventionalism, no doubt, would have stepped in with its ready 
    tear and faded &quot;<span class=SpellE>Resquiscat</span>.&quot; But <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> scorned Conventionalism, and copied human nature, 
    hard-hearted, frivolous, unrepentant, <span class=GramE>incorrigible</span>. 
    In his experience, harlots were harlots to the end of the chapter—and after. 
    There were no <span class=SpellE>magdalens</span> among them. Their mourning 
    was a mockery; their priest a profligate. He will not even have the poor child 
    impressed;--how should he be with such a mother? No, let him wind up his &quot;castle-top&quot; 
    in the foreground—&quot;the only thing in that assembly (as Lamb says) that 
    is not a hypocrite.&quot; This painter painted life as he saw it; he cared 
    to do no more (35-36).</p>

  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally, we arrive at the 
    funeral party—a ceremony of leave-taking attended by professional friends, 
    at which gin and tears are confusedly mingled. Only the bunter had seen Moll 
    die; now only the <a href="crone.htm">bunter</a>, who clutches a glass and 
    flagon, displays the fixity of real grief. Sighing, sipping or improving the 
    occasion with some pious sentiment, the ladies of <st1:street><st1:address>Drury

    some are confidential; some quickly pass thanks to the influence of <st1:city><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>Hollands</span></st1:place></st1:city>, from solemn valediction 
    to surreptitious byplay. Near the sprigs of <a href="plate.htm">rosemary</a> 
    arranged on a platter, <a href="kid.htm">the chief mourner</a> sits swaddled 
    in his weeds and, being a philosophic and much-experienced child, devotes 
    his attention to his brand-new spinning top. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> 
    sympathy with the characters of children clearly extended to an appreciation 
    of their intermittent callousness; or, rather, he would seem to have understood 
    what narrow and arbitrary limits confine their powers of suffering. But at 
    least the child’s indifference is a form of innocence and just above him, 
    as he sits by the <span class=GramE>coffin,</span> <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> 
    has placed two of the oddest and most subtly ill-favored of all his adult

    lap, while his fingers make tentative explorations among <a

    does not repulse, but pretends to ignore his sally, attempting, however, to 
    conceal it behind the wide brim of his mourning-hat. This decorous and resourceful 
    female was accepted as a likeness of Elizabeth Adams, a <span

  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The adventures of the heroine 
    are now concluded. She is no longer an actor in her own tragedy; and there 
    are those who have considered this print as a farce at the end of it: but 
    surely such was not the author’s intention.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The ingenious writer of 
    <span
class=SpellE><i>Tristram</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>Shandy</span></i> begins 
    the life of his hero before he is born; the picturesque biographer of Mary 
    <span class=SpellE>Hackabout</span> has found an opportunity to convey admonition, 
    and enforce his moral, after her death. A wish usually prevails, even among 
    those who are most humbled by their own indiscretion, that some respect should 
    be paid to their remains; that their eyes should be closed by the tender hand 
    of a surviving friend, and the tear of sympathy and regret shed upon the sod 
    which covers their grave; that those who loved them living should attend their 
    last sad obsequies, and a sacred character read over them the awful service 
    which our religion ordains with the solemnity it demands. The memory of this 
    votary of prostitution meets with no such marks of social attention or pious 
    respect. The preparations for her funeral are as licentious as the progress 
    of her life, and the contagion of her example seems to reach all who surround 
    her coffin. <a href="hug.htm">One of them</a> is engaged in the double trade 
    of seduction and thievery; <a href="mirror.htm">a second</a> is contemplating 
    <span class=GramE>her own</span> face in a mirror. <a
href="lady1.htm">The female who is gazing at the corpse</a> displays some marks 
    of concern, and feels a momentary compunction at viewing the melancholy scene 
    before her: but if any other <span class=GramE>part of the company are</span> 
    in a degree affected, it is mere maudlin sorrow, kept up by glasses of strong 
    liquor. <a href="john.htm">The depraved priest</a> does not seem likely to 
    feel for the dead that hope expressed in our liturgy. The appearance and employment 
    of almost every one present at this mockery of woe, is such as must raise 
    disgust in the breast of any female who has the least tincture of delicacy, 
    and excite a wish that such an exhibition may not be displayed at her own 
    funeral.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In this plate there are 
    some local customs which mark the manners of the times when it was engraved, 
    but are now generally disused, except in some of the provinces very distant 
    from the capital sprigs of rosemary were then given to each of the mourners: 
    to appear at a funeral without one, was as great an indecorum as to be without 
    a white handkerchief. This custom might probably originate at a time when 
    the plague depopulated the metropolis, and rosemary was deeded and antidote 
    against contagion. It must be acknowledged that there are also in this print 
    some things which, though they gave the artist an opportunity of displaying 
    his <span
class=SpellE>humour</span>, are violations of propriety and custom: such is her 
    child, but a few removes from infancy, being habited as chief mourner to attend 
    his parent to the grave; rings presented and an escutcheon hung up at the 
    funeral of a needy prostitute. <span class=GramE>the</span> whole may be intended 
    as a burlesque upon ostentatious and expensive funerals, which were then more 
    customary than they are now. Mr. Pope has well ridiculed the same folly: &quot;When 
    <st1:city><st1:place>Hopkins</st1:place></st1:city> dies, a thousand lights 
    attend/ <span class=GramE>The</span> wretch who, living, saved a candle’s 
    end.&quot;</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The figures have much characteristic 
    discrimination: the woman looking into the coffin ahs more beauty than we 
    generally see in the works of this artist. The undertaker’s gloating stare, 
    his companion’s leer, the internal satisfaction of the parson and his next 
    <span class=SpellE>neighbour</span>, are contrasted by the Irish howl of the 
    woman at the opposite side, and evince Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth’s</span> 
    thorough knowledge of the operation of the passions upon the features. The 
    composition forms a good shape, has a proper depth, and the light is well 
    managed (117-120).</p>

class=GramE>how</span> much could we not say here—if we were allowed to say it!
But we fear the prayers of the pious, respect the coffin-lid, and—are silent.</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If we survey that fathering
only cursorily or from a little distance, we are almost ready to believe we
have seen something like that before somewhere in the world, and expect to fin
something sad but still genteel. A coffin over which they are murmuring a
tender &quot;Sleep well!&quot;: a lot of crepe; a figure like a parson and
another like a sexton; a funeral escutcheon on the wall; a child in deep
mourning; rosemary, tears, and white handkerchiefs; they are waiting for the
hearse. Who in <span class=GramE>all the</span> world would suspect anything
reprehensible here? But just bring your eye a little nearer so that the parts
become individually distinct, and you will find that you have never <span
class=GramE>seem</span> anything like that before anywhere. Everything changes
and even partly vanishes. There is crepe without mourning and howling without
tears; not a trance of a parson nor of his sexton the arms are a lampoon and
the very coffin a counter—from brandy. It is abominable! Now guess what is
going on here? <span class=GramE>This the</span> reader will now partly hear
and partly guess quite easily.</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The room into which we are
looking here is either a room on the ground floor of the house wherein our
heroine died, or it belongs to the man who, <span class=GramE>against a</span>
certain gee, takes complete charge of the corpse. This is the man here with the
sexton face. The female part of the company consists entirely of sisters,
prioresses and abbesses of the Order of strict observance to which the deceased
belonged, undeniably one of the most numerous in the world. The Sisterhood of
Drury Lane is said to comprise more nuns than London has hackney-coaches, whose
number is estimated at a thousand; and though strict vigils and the martyr’s
death kill quite a few of them ever year, and transportations to Jackson’s Bay
have made considerable in-roads, there is not the slightest noticeable
diminution. They are waiting here for the removal of the coffin, which does not
seem to happen quite on time. It is usually so with departures, except perhaps
the departure from life, where everything happens much to soon: with the
removal to the churchyard, on the other hand, the procedure is often as
unpunctual as if one were hale hand hearty. However, they know what to do here;
they amuse themselves as best they can.</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In that gathering there are
thirteen living people, one dead and then a sort of intermediate one, a picture
in the mirror, thus fifteen altogether. Of these, three are standing by <span
class=GramE>themselves,</span> the other twelve are arranged in pairs. Two
pairs of living ladies together with those separate subjects make seven; a
living lady, paired with a dead one, makes nine; two highly alive Chapeaux with
two ladies of the same quality, makes thirteen; and finally a lady with her
reflection in the mirror—in the same capacity as the lady herself—gives
fifteen. We shall have something to say about each, even if only a word. We
begin with the left wing.</p>

<p>What strikes the eye immediately here is the big gun which has been posted
at the <span class=GramE>flank.</span> <span class=GramE>If compared but
perfunctorily with the figure sitting beside it, it could easily be taken for a
tear-bottle, but for this the shape has obviously far too much of the mortar
and howitzer.</span> It is really a drinking gun, a six-<span class=SpellE>pounder</span>
at least, loaded with <i><a href="jug.htm"><span class=SpellE>Nants</span></a> </i>(French
liqueur). Very peaceful and merely serving the function of bonfire and
fireworks for the column. The counterpart, a small mortar, is to be found near
the right wing upon the coffin-lid, and for the same purpose. This fire from
the wings, as we shall see, has an uncommon effect upon the centre. The moment
has been excellently chosen by the artist. It is, in effect, the moment when <span
class=GramE>age</span> exalted by <span class=SpellE><i>Nants</i></span><i> </i>approaches
the feelings of youth, and when the gathering resembles the beautiful picture
of the snake which with tail in mouth coils itself into a circle, to which
everything perfect in the world must eventually more or less conform. It will
stay like that-provided the hearse is not too long in coming and the coffin
does not lose through the delay the respect due to it. But let us now examine a
little closer how things stand.</p>

<p>The artillery is well served. The small mortar is taken charge of by the
snub-nose whom we already <span class=GramE>know,</span> and the howitzer by
the <a href="pray.htm">fire-toad</a> who in the corner there wrings both her
fore legs and stretches out a hind leg. If someone does not know what <span
class=SpellE><i>tragicus</i></span><i> <span class=SpellE>boatus</span><sup> </sup></i>is<span
class=GramE>,</span> he should look if he dares at that face. It does not bear
illumination, and is in need of none; we only beg our readers to note that what
shines so charmingly in the lovely mouth of that female gunner are not teeth
(for of these she has only a few), but the most indispensable part of her
swallowing-cursing-and-praying apparatus--her own <span class=SpellE>unsmoked</span>
tongue. She seems as if born for her <span class=GramE>department,</span> and
the howitzer form of her waist cannot be mistaken, at least it would hardly be
possible in a human being for the ends A and B to be nearer one another than
here; a deft surgeon could attend to both with one hand. Moreover, it almost
goes without saying that she only sits like that so long as she is not drinking
or pouring out. Might it be the woman who was kneeling in front of the coffer
in the last Plate? The faces, to be sure, are not quite alike, but <span
class=SpellE>Laocoon</span> also looked quite different on the day before his
misfortune from how he has looked these last few thousand years. <span
class=GramE>And the figure?</span> Well on such a day one puts on all the
clothes one has.</p>

<p>Next to this <st1:place>Patagonia</st1:place> face, which is one of the
unattached, we see the first of the couples, of European-London culture. <a
href="hug.htm"><span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Undertaker</a>, who is helping one
of the nuns to don her mourning-glove, makes use of that <span class=SpellE>favourable</span>
opportunity to submit to her a little request of easily understandable tenor,
and he does so with such good manners and with so much modest <span
class=SpellE>fervour</span> that it cannot possibly remain without response. In
fact, there is already something like the reflex of a gracious permission in
the very eye of the supplicant, although the sign by which it was granted is not
disclosed. But his assistance in putting on the glove was probably given in the
form of a question, and thereby gave opportunity for a reply which, however,
had to remain invisible. The contrast in these two faces is capital: the
undertaker has no other design but what eye and mouth betray, he is utterly
concentrated and as one-sided as possible-for the moment, at least; the girl's
eye on the other hand speaks of all-sidedness and design. However dim it may
seem, it certainly is not only the <span class=SpellE>Spiritus</span> rector of
this assembly which is dimming it; there is play-acting here which would betray
itself by the obvious traces of a triumphant smile at the blindness of the poor
trapped devil to anybody who does not happen to be that poor devil himself.
Drury <span class=SpellE>Laneites</span> do not forget themselves. With them
every movement, no matter how small, is meant not only for the hearts which
they openly attack, but, at least secretly, for their handkerchiefs as well. No
sooner does the harpy learn with the surface of her right arm that the heart is
full, than she already begins stealing with her left. This is the so-called
small souvenir from <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Undertaker; the big one will
follow suit.</p>

<p>Immediately after that first mixed couple come the four unmixed ones, one
after the other, if we go from the left wing towards the right; the first of
them represents an <a href="dance.htm">inspection</a>. Both members are, as we
see, of slightly more than middle age. In both can be observed a praiseworthy
and most reasonable economy of bosom, with which the young, thoughtless vermin
here are not yet willing to conform. One of them seems already of an age when
spectacles can be mislaid. As we see, they are needed here. The second, a lean
sufferer, has something between the <span class=GramE>fingers which seems</span>
to cause her pain and which is being examined by the first with surgical,
serious, and really expert touch and subtlety. What could that be? Or is it
perhaps nothing at all, and only signifies something? To be frank, we almost
suspect here (Greek may do it) deep <i>esoteric </i>wantonness under a
completely <i>esoteric </i>mask, about which, of course, one is free to say
what one likes. Oh! <span class=GramE>how</span> agreeable it is for a
commentator if he can slink away from a difficult passage to which he has
merely opened the door for the reader, without saying anything more than a few
conjuring words in Greek. The sufferer has warts on her fingers and, as is well
known, the dead know better how to remove warts than the living. The lady
without spectacles seems to think only of ways and means of bringing a wart
between the fingers in contact with the corpse. The problem is not easy. If the
nose will not do it, nothing else will. This makes the poor creature cry. But
only think what a rogue our artist is, even in his disguises. He conceals a
wanton thought and the concealment itself is again an act of wantonness, deep
too but more comprehensible than the first, though quite unconnected with it. I
have heard of a type of politics, deep and unfathomable, being disguised as
another, also deep but fathomable, and unconnected with the first (newspaper
politics), but I never heard of this sort of satire. The wart-remover, who is
in charge of the operation here, has two of them herself, but on her brows like
horns sprouting. Having brought the interpretation as far as this, the moral
becomes easier and easier, which is evidently that of the beam and the mote and
the brother's eye.</p>

<p>Behind that pair stands the third; a <a href="mirror.htm">pious sister in
conversation with another</a>, who shall have no name, in the mirror. <span
class=GramE>Undoubtedly the happiest couple of them all.</span> In every
combination by pairing in this world, a certain compensation of defects and
accomplishments in the subjects is necessary if the common happiness is to be
lasting. What you lack, I have, and what I lack, you have, is the firmest
foundation. But in the combination of which we are speaking here, that is quite
unnecessary, and for complete satisfaction it is quite sufficient if only one
of the members either has every possible accomplishment or, what amounts to the
same thing, believes she has them. Thus in our case the girl who presents her
back to us is young, and beautiful, or at least she thinks so herself; now if
this is granted she need not care a jot about the characteristics of the other,
and yet only see with what loving admiration they gaze at each other; like two
angels who pass and do not know one another. Each sees in the other a higher
creature, each admires and is admired, each bends the knee and the scene ends
in mutual adoration.</p>

<p>We shall postpone for a little while our contemplation of the fourth couple,
that is the union of the living and the dead women, because <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has used them, and rightly, it seems to us, as the coping stone of the Ark; we
shall turn now to the right wing, and thence proceed towards the zenith, as we
did before with the left.</p>

<p>Of the pair who <span class=GramE>fill</span> the right wing, we have a good
deal to say, and even more to be silent about. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
<span class=SpellE>honour</span> demands the one of us, and the respect which
we owe to our public the other. Yet the scene must and shall be understood,
although we may have to take the liberty of not always writing expressly
'devil', but instead something like <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Satan, or a
mere d….</p>

<p>This time, he as well as she <span class=GramE>are</span> admittedly
portraits. The <a href="slut.htm">girl</a> was a notorious creature called Mary
Adams who after innumerable acts of debauchery, committed while she was a young
girl, was ultimately <span class=SpellE>despatched</span> in her thirtieth
year, not to the New, but because of very aggravating circumstances, to the
Other World, for theft. She was hanged on September 50, 1757. Portraits have
been made of her, and the present one is thought to have been <span
class=SpellE>modelled</span> on one of them. Now since these Plates had already
appeared in 1754, and thus three years before her death, we can infer from it,
at least, that she owed her notoriety not to her last crime <span class=GramE>alone,</span>
or to the way in which she died. This might easily have been due to her
personal charm, which the face does not lack even here, where English
complexion and English teeth do not come into play, and where all the life
which a beautiful face should express to the world seems bent in upon <span
class=GramE>itself</span>. The man beside her is not a <a href="john.htm">clergyman.</a>
We beg our readers most earnestly not to entertain such a thought; anything
like that would necessarily be prejudicial to the artist, and thereby the whole
impression which this piece should make would be lost. There is merely a
clergyman's frock. The thing inside it here is one of the few eminent
scoundrels to whom <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has justly accorded an
infamous immortality; a Charters in his way. Would not the artist have done
better, someone might ask, had he spared the cloth here as well? We regard that
remark as very well founded; indeed, we are even convinced that it would have
been better. But since that is how matters stand, we must hear the artist's <span
class=SpellE>defence</span> as well. We undertake it with genuine pleasure and
in the sure hope that he will be acquitted.</p>

<p>In his works <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has made attacks on three
occasions upon people in parsons' clothes, that is true;<sup> </sup>but that he
ever attacked the profession of clergyman as such, we cannot recall. Out of
these three, two are portraits of well-known people, about whose despicable
character the voice of the public had already decided long before <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> voiced his opinion. He has thus done nothing but
what every honest man had done before him, except that he drew and painted
where others spoke or wrote. Whether the picture of the third is also a
portrait, we cannot say with certainty, but it would still show no
disparagement of an <span class=SpellE>honourable</span> calling if it were
not. The fellow is only a bit of a gourmand, and on an occasion which regularly
occurs but every seventh year. Apart from this he does not hide his doings in a
corner, but makes his feast, so to speak, right in the lap of his constituency,
before the eyes of his flock, who feast together with him, and it does not cost
his family a penny. Such conduct can hardly be called reprehensible. But here,
here the situation defies description. <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
certainly felt this very keenly. He therefore did something which he had never
done in any of his works, so far as we know; something which is hardly
compatible with his manner of satire (though in order to exonerate <span
class=GramE>oneself</span> completely, even such extraordinary methods may be
necessary). On the 1,200 copies for subscribers, he marked that vile creature
with a capital 'A' which referred to a footnote under the Plate where it is
clearly stated who he was, and where and how he managed to escape the law. Now
just imagine what a lawless creature that abomination must have been, when an
honest, well-known and well-esteemed man like <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
does not scruple to draw him thus for all the world to see, and, in addition,
virtually invokes justice against him. In this way, or so it seems to us, he
has not only proved that he did not intend to attack the clergy's estate, but
on the contrary, he has shown how much he had its <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
at heart. When hunting out subjects for satire, an occupation which he
tirelessly pursued, many an object that knew how to evade the activity of the
police and the law fell into his snare, and he acted rightly in delivering them
up to the authorities, or, if the authorities let them escape again through carelessness,
in giving them at the next opportunity the <i>coup de <span class=SpellE>grâce</span>
</i>himself.</p>

<p>This scoundrel, evidently the <span class=SpellE>Spadille</span><sup> </sup>among
the trumps in hearts, as the other black ace, the Undertaker, is the <span
class=SpellE>Basta</span>, was so well known under the name Couple-Beggar
(because he copulated for a few pence) that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
interpreters have forgotten his proper name, a feature which in itself speaks
for his great eminence in the profession. We have been assured that, apart from
that other occupation, he united himself <span class=SpellE>regulariter</span>
a couple of times a week-with the gutter. Not only symbolically, as the Doge of
Venice marries the <st1:place>Adriatic</st1:place>. Instead of throwing a
trifle into it, he threw in everything which he still had left in the
evening--himself. A Divine he has never been called, he was merely an adept at
holding Divine Services, and even there he <span class=GramE>Just</span>
babbled through the Marriage and Funeral service-for a few pence. His spiritual
hand, as it was called, never fished for more, but fished all the more
often-while his worldly hand demanded stole-fees wherever they could be found,
in pockets with and without bottom <i>ad infinitum. </i>This is well known.
Whether <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> tried to hint at something of this
sort here cannot well be decided. In his so-called spiritual hand, the left
one, he holds the funeral brandy very badly and stains his handkerchief with
it. Where the worldly one is, nobody, so far as we know, has yet been able to
decide. People have looked for it under Couple-Beggar's hat, which the <span
class=SpellE>Manille</span><sup> </sup>is holding very carefully in front of it,
but it has not been found there either. We therefore willingly abandon this <i>locum
<span class=SpellE>difficillimum</span> </i>and pass over with genuine
pleasure, in the way of commentators, to an easier one--to Snub- nose. She
stands at the foot of her friend's coffin with a mortar in her hand, like a
female <span class=SpellE>sutler</span> before the inn counter. I call that
feeling! And yet, to the <span class=SpellE>honour</span> of human nature,
there is in her wild look a kind of unmistakable disapproval at the <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span> of the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span>
couple. It absorbs, as one can see, her whole attention, and although her mouth
speaks of much latitude in such matters, yet her eye seems to find place and
time and hour somewhat unbecoming. It is a fine touch of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
to put even into that unfeeling tiger-face an expression of disapproval at such
bestiality, and thus to make even the stones cry out about it. In passing we
would beg our readers to recall for themselves what that creature has done and
suffered so far, and what sort of a life that is, and yet even as we read this,
it is still lived by countless women! But we do not wish to prejudice the views
to which this might give occasion about the inheritors of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Kingdom</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Heaven</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and their spiritual
guides!</p>

<p>Right in the background near the door we see the <a href="whisper.htm">fifth
couple</a>. If anyone does not know yet what it is to be befuddled, he ought to
look at this. We should almost like to melt with them when we observe how these
two hearts, which probably are not yet entirely depraved, fuse into one. What
bliss! They have the sensation of floating towards a Heaven of love and
friendship, and do not realize that the house of cards erected by the liquor
will, in the ensuing quarter of an hour, collapse beneath them and will send
them with acceleration into the depths where police, pillory, quack doctor and
the hemp beating association are ever ready to receive them.</p>

<p>One of the members of the sixth and last couple, the living one engaged in <a
href="lady1.htm">contemplation </a>of the dead, <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has not put for nothing into the centre of the picture. He wants us to take
special note of her. Just as she is at the apex of the semi-circle formed by
the assembly, where the two wings converge, so also converge in her role the
moral lines which the artist here wishes to draw. That is why the girl is also
one of <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> beauties. This is a point to
remember, for it might pass unnoticed. Moreover, the girl is not altogether
bad. Youth and freshness are there at least, and to these qualities is
addressed the moral which can best be expressed by the words from the coffin:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>What thou art and how thou art, I was too but a
short while ago. Abandon the path thou art treading; if not, think of this:
what I am now, thou too <span class=SpellE>shalt</span> be, and in a short
while.</p>

<p>Whether the little goose has heeded these words, cannot be ascertained from
her face; but that, if she has heard them, she will have forgotten them even
before the hearse arrives, this I think can be predicted with certainty.</p>

<p>Almost beneath the coffin, just as formerly beside the death-chair, sits
again the <a href="kid.htm">little heir</a>, occupied with a pain-alleviating
instrument. There it was a chop which he turned on the spit; here he winds a
top which he is going to spin in the chamber of mourning. It looks as if the
anodyne had worked well on the little chap. However, it may also be that what
one takes for the cause here is really the effect. The boy does not grieve, but
not because he is roasting his meat and winding his top, but he roasts and
winds because he does not grieve. Why should he fret? Just as he has no father,
since nobody knew who he was, so he had no mother either, because in the
society where he lived nobody had time to be one. Oh, the words father and
mother mean very much more than we usually find in their dictionary
definitions, and more than people think when they read them! Just as many a
child whose true parents are far beyond the grave finds, thank God<span
class=GramE>!,</span> a new father or a mother, so, alas! <span class=GramE>there</span>
are fatherless and motherless orphans whose parents are thoroughly enjoying
themselves day after day. Evidently the poor fellow has often been pushed from
one corner into another; but since the decease there will be one pusher less.
Even supposing that snub-nose will sometimes throw him into the corner <span
class=GramE>now,</span> there is still nobody near at hand to throw him back
again. From the boy's puny legs we might almost conclude that the anodyne
necklaces have not been of much use. That <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> has
dressed the boy up as chief mourner is a mockery in more than one respect;
children are never used in that role; it must always be a man of some presence
who would not disgrace an afflicted heart. But the expression could also imply
''the chief among the mourners', and in this way the situation becomes almost
ludicrous. For if the most deeply afflicted is winding his top shortly before
the cortège leaves, we can easily surmise how deeply afflicted the others must
be. The <span class=GramE>dish with rosemary as well as the little table with
the gloves and the glove-stretcher for the too-narrow fingers are</span> plain
enough, but the position of the pair of gloves is perhaps not without
intention. They seem to have moved apart as if shocked, and so as to clasp each
other again, and to shame by their example at least ten pairs of hands of flesh
and blood among the thirteen which are assembled here and are occupied in a
somewhat worldly manner.</p>

<p>About the mourning <a href="wallhanging.htm">escutcheon</a> on the wall,
although we shall describe it in accordance with our duty, we shall take good
care not to give an opinion, either as regards the aspirations which are to be
immortalized through it, or the demesnes which it is meant to indicate, since
we value peace, together with an ounce of family pride, more than all the <span
class=SpellE>honour</span> which we might perhaps win on this occasion with our
heraldic penetration. The instrument which we see here in triplicate on the
blue field is called in English 'spigot and <span class=SpellE>fosset</span>',
better written faucet. It is a sort of bung for barrels. This consists, as we
see, of two parts, of which the smaller, the <span class=GramE>spigot,</span>
is stuck into the larger, the faucet, just as the latter is itself stuck into
the barrel. In drawing wine, only the smaller one is drawn out and, when the
bottle is full, is pushed in again. It is the simplest cock in the world.
Despite our promise, we should be glad of permission to add a little remark
about that escutcheon because, as the reader will see immediately, our promise
will not really be broken thereby. We only gave our word as regards the
interpretation of pretended claims to relationships and demesnes, but by no
means of the wanton misuse which our rogue of an artist could make of a matter
quite innocent in itself. He has drawn the three cocks, probably with
intention, in such a way that, seen from a distance, they could be taken for
the three French lilies. Fine praise for the girl in her coffin to hang above
it the French escutcheon! I believe the rogue would have liked to hang the
three lilies themselves there had he not feared that one of the English
Kings-at-Arms would rap his knuckles for it. Were <span class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span>
English commentators apprehensive of some similar reward for their
interpretations? Not one of them says a word about it.</p>

<p>In the window sticks a body of such equivocal substance and form that one is
not quite sure whether it has been pushed in from the inside to close the gap,
or from the outside, and in that case, whether it was not the object itself
which made the hole it now fills. This latter type of interference with the
glazier's trade is something to which the virtuous young hooligans of <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
are very prone, when they suspect so much vice in a room, and especially a
funeral with the French escutcheon. One might even be grateful if they
calculate the hurling of the missile in such a way that, as here, it cures at
the same time the damage which it has caused.</p>

<p><span class=GramE>Finally a remark about <span class=SpellE>Roucquet's</span>
opinion of this Plate.</span> He holds that <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
would have done better had he finished the story with the death scene, and he
says of the present Plate, <span class=SpellE><i>c'est</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>une</span> farce <span class=SpellE>dont</span> la <span
class=SpellE>defunte</span> <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>est</span></span>
<span class=SpellE>pluto't</span> <span class=SpellE>l'occasion</span> <span
class=SpellE>que</span> la cause. </i>We are accustomed to seeing Frenchmen
often treat very serious matters as farces, and very trivial ones with gravity.
This only means that with the French all things are possible. But <span
class=SpellE>Roucquet</span> is really not entirely wrong. He has only missed
the main viewpoint from which the picture must be apprehended, and has looked
at it from another one, from which alas! <span class=GramE>it</span> has also
been conceived, and this in other words means so much as: <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span>
has really made a mistake. If <span class=SpellE>Roucquet</span> had hit
immediately upon the first viewpoint, his whole criticism might not perhaps
have materialized; <span class=SpellE>Hogarth</span> undeniably meant to say,
as Gray in his superb Elegy has expressed it so beautifully, that even the most
miserable and depraved, no matter how unsung they may die, find comfort in the
respect of some they leave behind and long for it. It is not only insult after
death (for who could remain insensitive to that?), but the mere thought of
laughing heirs which embitters the last moments even of the most light-hearted.
Do not the English regard it, for instance, as an aggravation of capital
punishment if the additional sentence is pronounced that the body is afterwards
to be taken to the dissecting room? And in other countries, is it not some
mitigation if the headless body is to be buried not beneath the gallows, but in
a corner of the churchyard? But what sort of funeral is it here? There are not
many steps, to be sure, between this sort of <span class=SpellE>honour</span>
after death and a burial beneath the gallows. This was undoubtedly <span
class=SpellE>Hogarth's</span> idea, and the funeral scene fits very well into
the whole, but how has he executed it? <span class=GramE>Certainly not
particularly well.</span> With such ceremonial; with a chief mourner who is
only a child, and even the deceased's own child; with an escutcheon, an
inscription on the coffin lid, and altogether with such pomp, no whore is
buried in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>, unless she were
one of some social standing. Nichols says a cortège of that nature would not
have been able to proceed, especially in those days, when the police were so
very bad. Satire of course is there, but unity is missing, and looked at from
that point of view, this sixth Plate does in a way acquire the appearance of a
Comedy after the Tragedy (69-80).</p>

    one: &quot;Man that is born of a woman!&quot; begins another. They mingle 
    those dreadful litanies about sin, and death, and shine; but al this while 
    Kate moves not. She is very still—still and cold as marble; she is very lovely 
    now; and, oh! <span class=GramE>what</span> a bring seraphic gleam is that 
    playing upon her face, bringing back to her that old look of innocence, purity 
    and childhood she once wore so becomingly.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The day is passing on, and 
    the yellow light grows duller. The figure on the bed, which is something other

    on.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yes! Death hath been there,

    Death hath changed that corrupt, dishonored body into something so serene, 
    so awful, and so beautiful that nay who had known the wearer in life, and 
    held her in contempt or pity, as the case may be, would approach her now with 
    a sense of something more terrible, more unreal, less earthly, pervading the 
    quiet sleeper; and the most callous would have felt some unquiet creeping, 
    and the haughtiest would have bowed the dead. Cold, shifting grey lights—now 
    lapsing into twilight, now crepuscular, now dark, darker—the garret, with 
    its one tenant, is now an awful sanctuary, which none dare approach.</p>

    with a soft, pale radiance on the still face and the closed eyes. Is there

    cherished thee—for the unhappy creatures have their moments of fierce and 
    hysteric <span class=SpellE>tendernesses</span>—they can sorrow for thee, 
    pity thee they ought to envy thee now more than ever, for thou hast <span

  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From the scores of surrounding 
    streets—from the hundreds of alleys lying round and about—there comes a hoarse, 
    deadened hum of human voices. Some are howling tipsy ballads far out below. 
    Hoarse, brawling voices, as of men in altercation—shrill <i>altos</i> of venomous 
    women quarrelling, with <span class=SpellE>tigerish</span> thirst to claw 
    their opponents tooth and nail, rise upon the air. The costermonger lifts 
    aloud his voice; the butcher cries. &quot;<span class=GramE>buy</span>! <span

    and accord—yet by some <span class=SpellE>marvellous</span> fusion, the whole 
    is toned down, and blended into a rhythmic harmony—I know not how—and as I 
    stand in that death-chamber, it seems to change, by gliding transitions, into 
    a tender, sobbing, mourning <span class=SpellE><i>threnos</i></span>; and 
    I kneel and pray, and my tears fall on those cold, cold cheek: for –for—I

    chase away the blue-devils—to raise up their spirits—to make life defiant 
    of death; for death in the house, look you, is a very awkward customer, and 
    it takes a good many glasses of strong waters to allay him.</p>
  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Presently, Mother Midnight, 
    with her fair-looking crew, with bare bosoms and flashing eyes—white incarnate

    selves again! The <span class=SpellE>syrens</span> here come from their hidden 
    caves—from their half-devoured carcasses and badly picked bones—to sit on 
    the banks, to play with their yellow locks, to sing—what? There are no such

    and jolly, and amorous; but into that <i>garret</i> there enters nothing save

  <p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The wild, ribald songs of

    ever mingling with this, with these also, through the interweaving hours of

    pityingly upon her, and upon us all, I pray. Amen! (113-115).</p>
