<p><span style='font-family:"MS Reference Sans Serif"'>The clergyman's
companion is another noteworthy figure. Her gaze, out of the plate and at the
viewer recalls <a href="../20/hp3small.htm">PLATE 3</a> where <a
href="../20/moll.htm">Moll</a> gives us almost the same look. Commentators have
typically seen <a href="../20/hp3small.htm">PLATE 3</a> as the point where
Moll's luck drastically reverses. Here, the nightwatch is breaking in to search
for her watch-thief highwayman lover. Her room's decrepit condition is a
distinct change from her more luxurious life as a kept woman. However, there
are remnants of Moll's power, ones that show she still has considerable
authority. First, she is literally ON TOP of her lover who is hiding under the
bed (as betrayed by the cat). The hat and twigs indicate not only a potential
preference for flagellation but hint at witchcraft, both of which demonstrate
female power. Moll attracts the gaze of the viewer, as does the woman in this
plate. So Moll's power does not die with her, and she and the foregrounded
woman become sisters in subversion--her power over the clergyman is apparent.
Another hint at this connection is the presence of the twigs (here seen in the
lady's hand and on the <a href="plate.htm">plate</a>). Although commentators
have alternately called the twigs yew branches and rosemary, they are certainly
reminders of branches in Moll's broom in <a href="../20/hp3small.htm">PLATE 3</a>.

<p><b>Other commentary:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

  <p><b><font color="#FF8000">Shesgreen:</font> </b>Their spiritual leader, the 
    clergyman (identified by Hogarth as &quot;the famous Couple-Beggar in The 
    Fleet&quot;), who is supposed to give a religious tone to the event, has his 
    hand up the skirt of the girl beside him. His venereal preoccupation causes 
    him to spill. The fact of the girl who covers his exploring hand with a mourning 
    hat is filled with a look of dreamy satisfaction (23).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#8000FF">Paulson, <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works</i>:</font></b><font color="#8000FF"> 
    </font>The parson is using his hat to conceal what his right hand is up to, 
    but in his concentration he spills his Nantz (brandy). </p>
  <p>In the copy published by Bowles the parson is labeled 'A' and is explained 
    as 'The famous Couple-Beggar in The Fleet, a wretch who there screens himself 
    from the justice due to his villainies, and daily repeats them'-i.e. he celebrates 
    clandestine or irregular marriages. He has also been identified as 'Orator' 
    Henley, but so has ever disreputable person in Hogarth's oeuvre (and this 
    parson resembles Henley much less than the parson in Midnight Modern Conversation, 
    Plate 134). The woman with whom he dallies has been tenuously connected with 
    Elizabeth Adams, who was hanged in January 1737/38 (149).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800080">Uglow:</font></b> The erotic play continues to the 
    end, and viewers (or voyeurs) might laugh more than weep. The clergyman, spilling 
    his brandy, has his hand up the skirt of a demure-looking woman who coyly 
    hides his gropings with her hat (209).</p>
  <p><o:p></o:p><b><font color="#314F44">Quennell:</font></b> The clergyman, who 
    will conduct the funeral,, so the portrait of a &quot;Fleet Chaplain,&quot; 
    a shady cleric established in the purlieus the gaol, who earned his keep by 
    the celebration of clandestine or irregular weddings, A soft, slippery, sheep-faced 
    man, whose dull prominent eyes, which goggle straight ahead, are beginning 
    to brim over with a vague concupiscence, he spills his flask of gin into his 
    lap, while his fingers make tentative explorations among his neighbour's petticoats. 
    She does not repulse, but pretends to ignore his sally, attempting, however, 
    to conceal it behind the wide brim of his mourning-hat. This decorous and 
    resourceful female was accepted as a likeness of Elizabeth Adams, a demi-mondaine 
    destined to be convicted of theft and hung in 1737 (100).</p>
  <p><b><font color="#800000">Lichtenberg:</font> </b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Of 
    the pair who fill the right wing, we have a good deal to say, and even more 
    to be silent about. Hogarth's honour demands the one of us, and the respect 
    which we owe to our public the other. Yet the scene must and shall be understood, 
    although we may have to take the liberty of not always writing expressly 'devil', 
    but instead something like Mr Satan, or a mere d . . . . .</p>

<p>This time, he as well as she are admittedly portraits. The girl was a
notorious creature called Mary Adams who after innumerable acts of debauchery,
committed while she was a young girl, was ultimately despatched in her
thirtieth year, not to the New, but because of very aggravating circumstances,
to the Other World, for theft. She was hanged on September 50, 1757. Portraits
have been made of her, and the present one is thought to have been modelled on
one of them. Now since these Plates had already appeared in 1754, and thus
three years before her death, we can infer from it, at least, that she owed her
notoriety not to her last crime alone, or to the way in which she died. This
might easily have been due to her personal charm, which the face does not lack
even here, where English complexion and English teeth do not come into play,
and where all the life which a beautiful face should express to the world seems
bent in upon itself. (73-74).</p>
