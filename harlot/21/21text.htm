href="hemp.htm">hemp</a> in Bridewell Prison, the House of Correction in Tothill 
    Fields, Westminster, for prostitutes, bawds, card-sharps, and the like. The 
    man next to her is a <a href="man2.htm">gambler</a>, with one of his torn 
    cards lying on the floor in front of him. The other women are low types, one 
    of whom, at the right, is destroying vermin in her clothes; the <a
href="woman2.htm">Harlot's servant</a> is sitting next to this woman, resting 
    as she ties her garter. A <a href="woman1.htm">woman stands behind the Harlot</a> 
    jeering at her finery; and among the rest the Harlot and the gambler stand 
    out because of their dress. A case was recorded of such a well-dressed woman 
    in Bridewell: Mary Muffet, &quot;a woman of great note in the hundreds of 
    Drury, who about a fortnight ago was committed to hard labour in Tothill-fields 
    Bridewell . . . where she is now beating hemp in a gown very richly laced 
    with silver&quot; (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-street Journal,</i> 
    Sept. 24, 1730). </p>
  <p style='text-indent:.5in'>The <a href="man.htm">warder</a>, or labor-master, 
    draws Moll's attention to the log and chain as a punishment if she does not 
    show more eagerness to beat hemp. He holds a rattan like the one shown in 
    the third plate. Behind the Harlot the stocks are in use: &quot;<a href="sign.htm">Better 
    to Work than Stand thus</a>&quot; and further down a whipping post with &quot;The 
    Wages of Idleness&quot; inscribed on it. The warder had reason for prodding 
    his charges--he sold their beaten hemp to a merchant, and with the money paid 
    for the prisoners' food and kept what remained. Accordingly, the prisoners 
    worked from 6 in the morning till 6 at night. On the shutter at the back of 
    the shed is an effigy of <a href="../20/men.htm">Sir John Gonson</a> (&quot;Sr 
    J G&quot;) hanging from a gallows, pointing to the prisoners' feelings about 
    the magistrate and to the final use that is made of the hemp they are preparing 
    (147). </p>

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Hogarth showed full well that he

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>In the fourth plate, <a href="harlot.htm">she</a> is beating 
    <a href="hemp.htm">hemp</a> in Bridewell among other petty thieves and prostitutes. 
    The <a href="man.htm">warder</a> will sell the product of their labour, spending 
    just enough on food to keep them standing at their work from six in the morning 
    until six at night. Moll's fine dreams are mocked, just as her fine dress 
    is tweaked by the leering, half-blind, <a href="woman1.htm">syphilitic crone</a> 
    behind her, perhaps the gaoler’s wife. She is hardly able to lift the heavy 
    hammer and her sexiness is grotesquely transferred to the over-ripe body of 
    her <a href="woman2.htm">bunter</a>, pulling up the ragged stocking with its 
    fashionable silk clocks, probably handed down from her mistress. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>When the prints came out, Moll was identified with Mary Muffet 
    a well- known Drury Lane character committed to hard labour in Tothill Fields 
    Bridewell in 1730, where she was reported as ‘now beating hemp in a gown very 
    richly laced with silver’. This kind of contrast had a dark allure; in 1725 
    young Saussure was agog to see a woman in fine linen and lace, committed for 
    stealing a gold watch from her lover. A queenly figure covered in sweat from 
    beating with her heavy mallet, she was wearing ‘a magnificent silk dress brocaded 
    with flowers. The captain took great heed other; he had made her arm quite 
    red with the little raps he gave her with his cane’. The hint of titillation 
    here, and in Hogarth's print, flowered unashamed in one verse commentary:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The women's prison, however, was more than an image of a 
    prostitute's decline or a sadist's delight. It was the incarnation of domination, 
    the body subdued and beaten for punishment and profit, not enjoyed for pleasure 
    In particular, the pregnant black whore in the background stung the imagination 
    of later eighteenth-century commentators like the irrepressibly responsive 
    Lichtenberg:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:48.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>‘a negress poor devil! And as I gather from her rotundity,

    Penitentiary for her whole family. Oh let us be thankful that we were born 
    with the colour of innocence and the livery of freedom.'</p>

text-autospace:none'>As is well known, Chemistry describes three stages of
fermentation: wine fermentation, acetous fermentation and putrid fermentation.
But these terms could also apply in quite other fields than Chemistry. One
might find analogous processes wherever organic matter of any kind, combined
with a volatile portion of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>je</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ne sais quoi,</i> life-force or spirit or
whatever it is, in varying proportions of quantity as well as intensity, takes
part in the cycle of Nature, which is characterized by stability amid constant
change. This is true of the life of individuals as well as of States, in the
whole as well as in part. The first fermentation of life, O how it rejoices the
heart of man! In what long draughts he imbibes enthusiasm and delight from
everything! A little time goes by and it is no more, as happened in the last
war, or whatever period the historian may choose. The pleasant taste has gone.
The drinker puts down the half-drained cup with a grimace and a disgusted shake
of the head. He no longer sees the sense of it; it is for- bidden fruit; it is
abominable—and up comes the sour face. But the process still goes on. Age makes
for carefulness, carefulness for mistrust, and mistrust makes a man still
older. Instead of with figures, he calculates with hyphens—upon the forehead,
and many a time between supper and breakfast makes a costly midnight feast off
his own fat. Thus one tooth after another falls out, one lock of hair after
another goes, and one faculty after another fails, and so he goes on, without
teeth, without hair, without faculties, or as Shakespeare says, 'sans
everything', through the last stage of fermentation towards putrefaction. Oh!
how he stinks! Away with him into the box with its wood-shavings; off to the
Resurrection<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>field with him, with the
mighty Thing that will never be seen again! Such is the life of man. Is it
otherwise with States and cities? All that remains from the glories of former
times are tombstones above a mighty corpse, or miserable off-shoots on a
decaying stump which drop off with every passing winter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>But life does not always pass so slowly and so regularly
through all the stages. Some people get through all their fermentations in the
time which for others is hardly sufficient for the first stage, and this is
often the fault of the fermenting agents. Lord Rochester, a notorious witty old
pig-skin, had grown old by his thirtieth year, was converted in his
thirty-first,' and died, utterly bored with life, in his thirty-third. All this
is quite possible, even with a constitution intended for a hundred years of
life. For that genius, as he himself used to boast, had once been drunk for
five years on end. Every calendar year he used up, on an average, three years
of his life, that is on a biometer whose scale is divided according to the
durability of the human body. Have there also been States of this kind? Two
years' wine fermentation, two years' acetous fermentation and two years'
putrefaction! It might be possible with a proud and rash people who always
acted first and thought afterwards. </p>

penitentiary, of which this apartment appears to be the refectory or
Activity-room, for the purpose of <a href="hemp.htm">beating hemp</a> during
her leisure hours, and of such, alas, the day mostly consists here; or if she
does not make a success of it, to let herself be beaten. In that event she will
have leave to rest, like the fellow behind her, who a boy once thought, when he
saw that engraving, was looking for sparrows' nests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>At a perfunctory inspection, it looks as if they were not
too badly housed here. The company is fairly numerous, not entirely wicked,
and, although in prison, they are at least not in imprisoned air; all is very
airy and high, and that is something, especially on the border line
of—putrefaction. She stands on the right wing of the file as file-leader, in a
'winged' cap, and altogether very much be-winged. Apparently she has been
caught in the guise of a night-butterfly, and incorporated in that motley
collection, or she has at least the colourful apparel in which she used to
flutter at night around the lantern. But this item deserves a closer
inspection. How is it, one might ask, that the girl has arrived here so decked
out, since she has been fetched out of her bed and would hardly have been given
time to dress up like that? For supposing she has tried on her head-gear four
or five times, and every other article of clothing on an average about twice,
and this surely is the least that can be assumed, she could easily have taken
from two to three and a half hours. At that rate the butterfly-catchers would
not earn their shoes. And then let us not forget the miserable mirror leaning
against the punch bowl, which would reflect hardly a fiftieth part of that
magnificent structure, and which would have to be shifted from zone to zone,
each barely a few hands broad, all round the firmament, for her to see whether
there was too much here or too little there. Do not some ladies require three
hours to attire them- selves for a Ball, and that when four hands are at work,
and with a mirror in which, as they step in front of it, they can survey the
whole sky? No, that would not do; so much patience cannot be asked of bailiffs,
and could hardly be expected, if it were asked. For we cannot help observing in
the hand of one of them in the third Plate the very instrument which the man
here, whom we have just designated as the brewery-scullion, is also holding. Wherever
that appears, it is never as an emblem of patience. I believe it is called a
cowhide whip. Thus I can see only two ways of solving this puzzle. Either this
is not the first arrest, one that ended perhaps merely with a private
castigation, which however had no effect. I should be very sorry if that were
so; and so we come to the second (and surely the fairest) interpretation: the
girl was taken away covered only so much as the cool air and the gaze of
curious nature-lovers in the street made necessary, and had her wardrobe sent
after her. Now we know that in England nobody may be sentenced without a
hearing, and that in the places where people are heard, they are also very much
seen. It is an important moment for a poor sinner who relies to some extent
upon her pretty face and figure. She knows for certain that her misdeeds will
find an inexorable and incorruptible judge in the grave individual who sits
opposite her under the sword of justice. But she knows, too, that among the
non-professionals around her, her face, her figure, her hair, and her whole
bearing will find many a judge who will not take the matter so seriously,
people who have not sworn an oath to regard a pretty girl as immediately
reprehensible or even distasteful, just because she had been caught while on
duty. If therefore in England a woman is brought before the Judge, and if in
addition to a pretty face she possesses of good manners at least the form, and
of clothes either possesses, or knows how to procure, the substance, then one can
be sure of something worth seeing. The name of a Mrs Rudd, who in the year 1775
brought the twin brothers Perreau to the gallows, from which she escaped
herself only through that kind action of hers, is surely immortalized by all
the magazines of that time—if the magazines themselves are still in existence.
Everything she wore was described and painted ribbon for ribbon and bow for
bow. Her head-gear, which decency itself seemed to have arranged, was analysed,
and painted for the benefit of those who might perhaps have felt the desire to
catch a few Perreaux themselves; greater honour could not have been accorded to
a Madame Siddons as Cordelia or Desdemona. That was going rather far. But who
would reproach a girl like this if she rakes together her all (which is so
little) against the day of reckoning? The jury are of course forbidden to let
themselves be dazzled by it, but the poor sinner is not forbidden to believe in
the possibility. Even if the blow itself could not be averted thereby, still it
might awaken some Samaritan or other among the spectators who would afterwards
pour oil into the wound; for in London there are some queer Samaritans, and
among them, no doubt, somebody upon whom such a creature with its heavy
mule-trappings would make just as great an impression as did the dancing Grace,
Julie Potocki, upon a certain man of the world, and one of the finest
sentiment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Molly
was found guilty at the Bar and sentenced to be privately whipped, and also to
serve a term of hard labour, beating hemp. And it is of course a slight
intensification of the punishment to make her start in that attire. When she
has run the gauntlet of her fellow-prisoners' tongues, she will make herself
more comfortable. Already, over there on the wall, hang a crinoline and a braided
hat which are no part of the prison livery. How dull her eyes have grown! The
dark rings around them are very noticeable, even in an engraving. Her mouth,
how helplessly agape, and her whole face, how puffy! What a few false steps in
the world can do, if they are the kind that lead to the medicine bottle! How
heavy her poor heart must be! And how awkwardly she holds the hammer! With the
left hand high up and the right a long way down. This is not the way to beat,
at least not hemp—nor sugar either. Alas! it is a hopeless task for her, she
cannot bear to look at it, she cannot and cannot beat. But 'thou shalt and
must' is written on that face of bronze beside her, in letters which without
punctuation can be read and understood the whole world over. It was quite
unnecessary to stress the words by an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accent
grave!</i> I mean the oblique cowhide is quite redundant—the face speaks for
itself. Is he not a rogue of a warder, as if designed by Nature for such a
herd? Just like Daphnis in Vergil, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>But
do our readers know who it was that torturer resembles as one egg another? Mr
Magister Thwackum, tutor to the two brothers Blifil and Tom Jones. Fielding
says so expressly. As is well known, that learned man provided the religious
instruction in the boys' education. Did he too give his lessons in a white
apron, I wonder? It has a sort of domestic-preparatory look about it, something
exciting expectation, and at the same time suggesting to a bad conscience the
idea of fleecing which, if used only as a deterrent, cannot possibly do any
harm. That fellow's metal, though, is not altogether base; indeed, his upper
half might even inspire respect if one were to put in his hand, in place of the
cowhide, some instrument which had at least a different name. In order,
however, not to prejudice our readers too much against the man, or to make them
apprehensive for the poor prisoner in the charge of such a tyrant, we ought to
mention that people of that sort have always at their command, apart from the
faces for which they are paid by the municipal authorities, and those which
they have to produce gratis, at least half a dozen others which can be bought
against a small consideration. These are usually served up entirely without
cowhide, and some of them, as I have been told, even with a genial cross-slash
beneath the nose, from one ear to the other. What we see here is only ordinary
fare, by way of entree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Immediately behind our heroine stands the <a
href="woman1.htm">wife</a> of that <a href="man.htm">Master of the Ceremonies</a>,
holding over the sufferer's head a whip of quite another sort which hurts only
the soul—the lash of the most impudent derision. Should the Devil decide to
animate one of his puppets in the world for some doubtful purpose, his fingers
and expression as he grips the wires could hardly differ much from that woman's
as she fingers the lace and ribbons or the handkerchief here. Could one easily
imagine a more satanic physiognomy? And yet her expression is still of the kind
which fits such faces best; namely, the ironic. Illuminated by rage and brandy
it would gain tremendously in force, and still not be caricature. Oh till you
have set eyes on such a creature, you have seen nothing of the world! If she is
not actually removing the handkerchief from the pocket, as Ireland believes,
she is surely drawing a witty comparison for the amusement of her husband and
the gratification of her own heart, between the bridal adornment of the lady
and the tomb in which she has been buried here. One other eyes is not so much
shut as non-existent, but the face loses nothing on that side in the way of
light: all is richly compensated by the splendour of the ivories which that
rattle-snake displays so inimitably that one hardly notices her eye is missing.
If the greeting 'I'm absolutely delighted to see you here!' has ever been heard
in that establishment, it could only have proceeded from such a slash of a
mouth. So much for the torturer's— torturess. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Just let us run down the row of penitents—what a
hammer-scale it is! What music! Curiously enough there are just seven of
them—Doh, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. The pair in the foreground do not count,
since they are not performing for the time being. Whether something is in need
of repair, or whether they have finished playing for today (since their hammers
are at rest, and also there is no hemp lying on their block), I shall not
venture to decide. Also there seems to be something like a small ditch between
their place and that of the others. This may indicate that even here there are
two classes, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>prima</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>secunda.</i> Or is it that our Molly stands
upon a platform as an example to the others, and that she works here in the
pillory? That only half of the <a href="dog.htm">dog</a> is visible really
indicates such an elevation, and since rank is unthinkable without its
insignia, just at that raised spot a ring is let into the ground, attached to a
buttress-like stump of wood to obstruct or lessen movement. But let us return
to our musical scale and to the hammer-mill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Next to our keynote <a href="man2.htm">Doh</a> there
hammers Re, quite a dignified old man. I once saw an old copper-plate engraving
of an ambassador being received in audience, who looked exactly like him, and
who stood almost in the same attitude, only there was no hammering there,
though maybe there was some talk about it. Really if we were to see that man in
an honest workhouse in the guise of a Superintendent Police Inspector, or as a
tutor in his study, we should think in the first case that he practised
hemp-beating like the Chinese Emperor ploughing, and in the second like the
dogs who eat grass when they have an upset stomach. How could he have landed
here? The interpreters believe he is a card-sharper. They deduce this from the
torn playing-card which lies on the floor in front of his work table. It is
quite true, the man has something about him which usually characterizes people
of that sort. Nature in her wisdom, while tolerating these poisonous snakes,
usually puts into their appearance and apparel something which fills the office
of a rattle, and gives warning to the bystanders without the snake itself being
aware of it. There is always something not quite as it should be. Sometimes
their clothing is out of season, sometimes even out of century. Full-dress
uniform of the Peace of Ryswick period worn at the Coronation of Francis I, or
magnificent furs on a cool evening in August. That is one of the idiosyncrasies
of this class of human beings, and which class is without them? The card is an
eight of spades, but there are no such eights with four spades in a row. Most
likely it is an 'improved' nine. The two pieces say: three opposite five and one
in reserve makes the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>alterum tantum.</i>
That certainly spells some fraud. Oh! if only the remark about prophesying from
the coffee grounds had not already been made above, here would be an
opportunity to sell ink without trouble and at a good price too!—like cinnamon
oil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the point has its difficulties.
We must not, then, pass it over too lightly. One might ask: how does the card
come to be here? Has he pulled it out with his handkerchief, and why is it in
two pieces? Was it perhaps so often bent over in play that ultimately it had to
fall apart? The shallowness of the English commentators on this occasion is as
strange as it is incomprehensible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Surely a point like that must have been easy enough to clear up at the
time. After all, what is the point of writing if one adds nothing to the old
capital? A foreigner can do nothing here but grope, and must be satisfied if he
does not make a fool of himself before the native expert. So here goes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>To me the man seems not so much a gambler by profession as
an old fortune-hunter who has tried his hand at everything, gambling included,
and after being utterly ruined by it has taken to other paths which finally
brought him here. With such a fate, a man might easily come to curse all
playing cards, and on finding one still in his coat pocket might tear it up and
throw it down before beginning—to beat hemp. I regard him as one of those
notorious people who give the London Law Courts a lot of work every year, and
who in English are called 'swindlers'. 'Swindler', incidentally, one of the
words which the great Doctor Johnson has omitted in his equally great
Dictionary, means in English a felon who through cunning subterfuges, and
usually with the appearance of a man of rank and means, tries to defraud people
of their property. For carrying out these stratagems, an interim wife, at least
as decoy, is an indispensable article; she does the talking and he the job. I
fear, I almost fear, our Doh and Re are such a couple. That their places are
next one another, that they are both so magnificently overdressed and both in
the same taste, adds weight to that assumption. Whether Re used Doh, or Doh
used Re in the operation, we shall not decide; perhaps their parts stood in the
relation of the three to the five on the torn card and thus differed from the
relation of equality only by one-eighth of the total load. It may be that after
long search they were finally arrested in their State carriage and brought here
after a short trial, and the obvious distinction of our heroine would then
appear to be a consequence of a second arrest, which is always connected with
certain disagreeable attentions. Whoever finds this reason for Molly's presence
here more plausible than the one given above, may adopt it; it is really only a
matter of taste. That the braided hat on the wall belongs to our Re goes
without saying. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>After
Re comes Mi, a mere child, the most wretched object in this Plate. Hardly in
her 'teens, she is already under this roof, suffering for a crime of which she
had no conception, and into whose mere form she had been forcibly initiated,
like a poodle into its antics. Anyone coming from the seat of virtue, I mean
from the small towns of Germany, to London, must feel his heart bleed if, of an
evening, he comes across such little creatures of twelve or thirteen, dressed
like ballet shepherdesses, being handled and intercepted with theatrically
tender embraces. It really beggars description. They speak in a sweet childish
voice and with a volubility obviously acquired through learning by rote, about
things of which they certainly do not understand one word. One is therefore
almost tempted to regard them as children about to be confirmed, if all this
did not belong to a Catechism which only Charters or the Devil could have
written. It cries to heaven. The poor girl has something good-hearted in her
physiognomy, and the zeal with which she is beating her hemp shows a
willingness to follow any instruction. Good heavens! If this child deserves the
penitentiary, what punishment would they not merit whose instructions have
poisoned her innocence before she had time to reflect, and her youth before it
had fully ripened?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>We come now to the fourth note, Fa, the short, roundish
thing who, propped on her hammer, is pausing a moment, a perfect little Satan.
Her eyes, a charming pair of deadly-nightshade berries, seem to be directed
upon a mosquito which is buzzing about in the air hardly three inches from her
nose, but in reality they are aimed at the gaudy nightbird. No. 1 in the
Cabinet, and its beautiful wings. She is taking a very sharp aim and is sure to
make a hit when she lets fly. I should like to hear that girl talk. Near her
Hogarth has added one of those touches which characterize him so perfectly; in
these six Plates they are not very often to be found, but are increasingly
apparent as his genius approaches maturity. It is a point which none of the
English commentators has noticed. Behind the girl, there stands the well-known
post with the iron collar, which can be seen in Germany, too. It bears the
inscription, 'The Wages of Idleness'. Thus Fa is taking a rest immediately
below the Tables of the Law which prohibit such respite, and not only that,
since her Northern portion leans so far forward, her Southern parts are
obviously turned against the Tables, which in every nation is recognized as a
lack of respect. Here it is doubly indecent to direct that Pole upon a mere
inscription, for although we know that this end sometimes accepts chastisement,
we should not easily find an example of its ever having been used to receive a
written warning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Sol, the fifth from our heroine, is quite a goodlooking
girl; anyone attracted by passive obedience could hardly take his eyes off her.
I have come across just such a face once before, but whether in Nature or in a
picture, on the cook of a Cathedral Chapter or on a Sphinx, I cannot now
recall. A slightly mechanical aptitude for service and also a slightly Egyptian
parallelism can hardly be missed in the face and in the whole way she is
holding her head. Her hammer is very heavy; she seems scarcely able to lift it
without supporting her elbow on her hip. By all the rules of perspective it is
obviously bigger than those of her neighbours. Could there perhaps be lead in
it? Mr Thwackum, perchance, has different hammers as he has different faces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>La is a negress, poor devil! And as I gather from her
rotundity, a double one besides. What a nest of prisons for the embryo!
Imprisoned in a mother who herself sits in the Penitentiary, in a world which
again is a Penitentiary for her whole family. Oh let us be thankful that we
were born with the colour of innocence and the livery of freedom. Thou blessed
Sun, grant us only that and good health and our Ananas Troglodytes,! the rest
we shall surely provide for ourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Ti concludes the series. She is like Cordelia in <i

least'. She works more earnestly than all the rest, is also the only one who
grasps the hammer with the right hand above. She sees little and we see little
of her, and yet she does a good deal, or rather that is just why she does a
good deal, just as in the great Workhouse of the World. After that little moral
sermon from the coffee grounds, we now turn to the two <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The <a href="woman2.htm">foremost</a> is evidently the <a
href="../20/maid.htm">pug-nosed horror</a> who poured out water for the tea on
the third Plate. That she was brought here as well shows that she is something
more than a mere servant. She looks rather pleased about the fate of her
fosterchild, and appears to be giving the glad eye to the cowhide which today,
perhaps for the first time, is a good distance away from her. Hogarth had
already provided her with an ample supply of bosom in the third Plate,
evidently not without reason; here she seems to consist almost entirely of
bosom and legs. The fancy stockings which she is pulling up here evidently do
not belong to her sex, since they unpermittedly and quite indecently reach up
too high, and have clearly not been woven for knees—of the weaker sex, which
require more space. Hence the evident break-through in this region. Black with
white clocks, or even silver ones! If we only knew the Court and town fashions
of those days, we might perhaps hazard a guess as to who had lost them. But as
it is, we must declare them, together with the embroidered shoes, as the
acquired property of the woman who, in order to impress town and Court had, in
the appearance of her legs at least, to try to imitate them. The whole figure
is not a masterpiece of drawing, nor of light and shade. Where does the
brightness under her skirt come from? Phosphorescence is out of the question,
for whence should that emanate? And yet one can see so clearly. Most likely it
is only a reflection of the light in the roguish eyes of the artist, which for
one brief moment illuminated the character of that infamous creature so as to
cause decency itself to look that way. To pull up the stocking she grips it,
perhaps with a remnant of modesty, now at least, using her fist like a handle
at the knee. The garter, to judge from the gentle undulations which it readily
assumes, appears to have been cut from a piece of old oilcloth. Next to her
sits another such creature. Mr Ireland says she is occupied with one of the
Egyptian plagues; this is clear enough. Both appear to be versed in the beating
of hemp; it is not the first time for them. Their finished task is in the
basket above them. They thus have time before dinner to make their toilet, each
in her own way. </p>

shutter or cup- board door, is a picture of the gallows drawn with chalk in
guard-room style, with a man hanging from it, smoking his little pipe. The
gallows are well drawn, they are familiar with it under that roof; moreover it
often becomes the Estate of this aristocracy when they leave town. The man on
it is a mere cipher. Above is the inscription S.J.G. (<a href="../20/men.htm">Sir
John Gonson</a>), the name of the honest man whom we mentioned in the third
Plate. It is clearly the joke of a scoundrel carried out in chalk because he
was too cowardly or too pious to do something like that with a stiletto. The
pipe in the mouth has little significance. Every honest man engraved on a
copper-plate has to put up with that sort of thing. I have often seen portraits
of the most honest people, especially those who have been specially assiduous
in the education of the young, decorated with that pipe by those very youths,
and with a moustache as well which stuck out pitch-black beyond the powdered
wig. It is a bad joke, but, of course, to allow a picture of oneself, beard and
all, to be put in the front of a little school book so as to make oneself and
the book venerated is not much better. To see such a figure, so very modern,
and yet already engraved on copper, is a rarety; had it lain 1,500 years under
volcanic ashes, we should not waste a word over it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The fellow who appears to be bird-nesting is really
standing in the prison Stocks, and so has first to work honestly before he can
become a rogue of ordinary degree. On the board over the Stocks we read:
'Better to work than stand thus.' The scene needs no explanation except to
mention that in all probability the delinquent (the squeezed-in one) has made a
secret plea for his liberation to Mrs Gaoler by a correspondence which might
quite easily be carried on here by way of their lower Poles. Nothing else
remains now but the dog, no easy item if one has to deal with such an
unfathomable rogue as Hogarth. Is he meant to be here only as a volunteer, in
evidence of un-human faithfulness towards a master whom he has followed into
prison? This moral is somewhat too plain for our moralist; also we have already
had an example of that with the Egyptian plague <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in secunda;,</i> and there it even had a moral tailpiece which is
missing here, that is to say the reward which we are accustomed to expect in
this world in return for extreme devotion. This does not fit. I think,
therefore, it must be the sheep-dog of the lovely shepherd and his shepherdess
who has to watch over and prevent certain movements of the herd while the
loving couple is engaged on operations. What may not a dog learn? That he
pricks his ears so much towards the wing commanded by his master is very
understandable. Well does he know the voice which thunders against Molly.
Evidently it is also the very formula with which he is sometimes received. He
believes it is meant for him. For everything here is free and equal, so far as
is possible under a cowhide (40-51).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></p>
