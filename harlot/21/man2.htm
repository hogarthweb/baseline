    </font></b>Next to our keynote <a
href="man2.htm">Doh</a> there hammers Re, quite a dignified old man. I once saw 
    an old copper-plate engraving of an ambassador being received in audience, 
    who looked exactly like him, and who stood almost in the same attitude, only 
    there was no hammering there, though maybe there was some talk about it. Really 
    if we were to see that man in an honest workhouse in the guise of a Superintendent 
    Police Inspector, or as a tutor in his study, we should think in the first 
    case that he practised hemp-beating like the Chinese Emperor ploughing, and 
    in the second like the dogs who eat grass when they have an upset stomach. 
    How could he have landed here? The interpreters believe he is a card-sharper. 
    They deduce this from the torn playing-card which lies on the floor in front 
    of his work table. It is quite true, the man has something about him which 
    usually characterizes people of that sort. Nature in her wisdom, while tolerating 
    these poisonous snakes, usually puts into their appearance and apparel something 
    which fills the office of a rattle, and gives warning to the bystanders without 
    the snake itself being aware of it. There is always something not quite as 
    it should be. Sometimes their clothing is out of season, sometimes even out 
    of century. Full-dress uniform of the Peace of Ryswick period worn at the 
    Coronation of Francis I, or magnificent furs on a cool evening in August. 
    That is one of the idiosyncrasies of this class of human beings, and which 
    class is without them? The card is an eight of spades, but there are no such 
    eights with four spades in a row. Most likely it is an 'improved' nine. The 
    two pieces say: three opposite five and one in reserve makes the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>alterum tantum.</i> That certainly spells some fraud. Oh! if only the 
    remark about prophesying from the coffee grounds had not already been made 
    above, here would be an opportunity to sell ink without trouble and at a good 
    price too!&#8212;like cinnamon oil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But 
    the point has its difficulties. We must not, then, pass it over too lightly. 
    One might ask: how does the card come to be here? Has he pulled it out with 
    his handkerchief, and why is it in two pieces? Was it perhaps so often bent 
    over in play that ultimately it had to fall apart? The shallowness of the 
    English commentators on this occasion is as strange as it is incomprehensible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Surely a point like that must have been easy 
    enough to clear up at the time. After all, what is the point of writing if 
    one adds nothing to the old capital? A foreigner can do nothing here but grope, 
    and must be satisfied if he does not make a fool of himself before the native 
    expert. So here goes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>To me the man seems not so much a gambler by profession as
an old fortune-hunter who has tried his hand at everything, gambling included,
and after being utterly ruined by it has taken to other paths which finally
brought him here. With such a fate, a man might easily come to curse all
playing cards, and on finding one still in his coat pocket might tear it up and
throw it down before beginning&#8212;to beat hemp. I regard him as one of those
notorious people who give the London Law Courts a lot of work every year, and
who in English are called 'swindlers'. 'Swindler', incidentally, one of the
words which the great Doctor Johnson has omitted in his equally great
Dictionary, means in English a felon who through cunning subterfuges, and
usually with the appearance of a man of rank and means, tries to defraud people
of their property. For carrying out these stratagems, an interim wife, at least
as decoy, is an indispensable article; she does the talking and he the job. I
fear, I almost fear, our Doh and Re are such a couple. That their places are
next one another, that they are both so magnificently overdressed and both in
the same taste, adds weight to that assumption. Whether Re used Doh, or Doh
used Re in the operation, we shall not decide; perhaps their parts stood in the
relation of the three to the five on the torn card and thus differed from the
relation of equality only by one-eighth of the total load. It may be that after
long search they were finally arrested in their State carriage and brought here
after a short trial, and the obvious distinction of our heroine would then
appear to be a consequence of a second arrest, which is always connected with
certain disagreeable attentions. Whoever finds this reason for Molly's presence
here more plausible than the one given above, may adopt it; it is really only a
matter of taste. That the braided hat on the wall belongs to our Re goes
without saying. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>After
Re comes Mi, a mere child, the most wretched object in this Plate. Hardly in
her 'teens, she is already under this roof, suffering for a crime of which she
had no conception, and into whose mere form she had been forcibly initiated,
like a poodle into its antics. Anyone coming from the seat of virtue, I mean
from the small towns of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>, must feel his heart
bleed if, of an evening, he comes across such little creatures of twelve or
thirteen, dressed like ballet shepherdesses, being handled and intercepted with
theatrically tender embraces. It really beggars description. They speak in a
sweet childish voice and with a volubility obviously acquired through learning
by rote, about things of which they certainly do not understand one word. One
is therefore almost tempted to regard them as children about to be confirmed,
if all this did not belong to a Catechism which only Charters or the Devil
could have written. It cries to heaven. The poor girl has something
good-hearted in her physiognomy, and the zeal with which she is beating her
hemp shows a willingness to follow any instruction. Good heavens! If this child
deserves the penitentiary, what punishment would they not merit whose
instructions have poisoned her innocence before she had time to reflect, and
her youth before it had fully ripened? (46-48).</p>
