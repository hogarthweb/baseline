    Fields, <st1:city><st1:place>Westminster</st1:place></st1:city>, for prostitutes,

href="man2.htm">gambler</a>, with one of his torn cards lying on the floor in 
    front of him. The other women are low types, one of whom, at the right, is 
    destroying vermin in her clothes; the <a href="woman2.htm">Harlot's servant</a> 
    is sitting next to this woman, resting as she ties her garter. A <a
href="woman1.htm">woman stands behind the Harlot</a> jeering at her finery; and 
    among the rest the Harlot and the gambler stand out because of their dress. 
    A case was recorded of such a well-dressed woman in Bridewell: Mary Muffet, 
    &quot;a woman of great note in the hundreds of Drury, who about a fortnight 
    ago was committed to hard labour in Tothill-fields Bridewell . . . where she 
    is now beating hemp in a gown very richly laced with silver&quot; (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grub-street Journal,</i> Sept. 24, 1730) (147).

    will sell the product of their labour, spending just enough on food to keep 
    them standing at their work from six in the morning until six at night. Moll's 
    fine dreams are mocked, just as her fine dress is tweaked by the leering, 
    half-blind, <a href="woman1.htm">syphilitic crone</a> behind her, perhaps 
    the gaoler&#8217;s wife. She is hardly able to lift the heavy hammer and her 
    sexiness is grotesquely transferred to the over-ripe body of her <a href="woman2.htm">bunter</a>, 
    pulling up the ragged stocking with its fashionable silk clocks, probably 
    handed down from her mistress. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>When the prints came out, Moll was identified with Mary Muffet 
    a well- known Drury Lane character committed to hard labour in Tothill Fields 
    Bridewell in 1730, where she was reported as &#8216;now beating hemp in a 
    gown very richly laced with silver&#8217;. This kind of contrast had a dark 
    allure; in 1725 young Saussure was agog to see a woman in fine linen and lace, 
    committed for stealing a gold watch from her lover. A queenly figure covered 
    in sweat from beating with her heavy mallet, she was wearing &#8216;a magnificent 
    silk dress brocaded with flowers. The captain took great heed other; he had 
    made her arm quite red with the little raps he gave her with his cane&#8217;. 
    The hint of titillation here, and in Hogarth's print, flowered unashamed in 
    one verse commentary:</p>

    </b>Our heroine has, in fact, been brought to the penitentiary, of which this 
    apartment appears to be the refectory or Activity-room, for the purpose of 
    <a href="hemp.htm">beating hemp</a> during her leisure hours, and of such, 
    alas, the day mostly consists here; or if she does not make a success of it, 
    to let herself be beaten. In that event she will have leave to rest, like 
    the fellow behind her, who a boy once thought, when he saw that engraving, 
    was looking for sparrows' nests. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:24.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>At a perfunctory inspection, it looks as if they were not
too badly housed here. The company is fairly numerous, not entirely wicked,
and, although in prison, they are at least not in imprisoned air; all is very
airy and high, and that is something, especially on the border line of&#8212;putrefaction.
She stands on the right wing of the file as file-leader, in a 'winged' cap, and
altogether very much be-winged. Apparently she has been caught in the guise of
a night-butterfly, and incorporated in that motley collection, or she has at
least the colourful apparel in which she used to flutter at night around the
lantern. But this item deserves a closer inspection. How is it, one might ask,
that the girl has arrived here so decked out, since she has been fetched out of
her bed and would hardly have been given time to dress up like that? For
supposing she has tried on her head-gear four or five times, and every other
article of clothing on an average about twice, and this surely is the least
that can be assumed, she could easily have taken from two to three and a half
hours. At that rate the butterfly-catchers would not earn their shoes. And then
let us not forget the miserable mirror leaning against the punch bowl, which
would reflect hardly a fiftieth part of that magnificent structure, and which
would have to be shifted from zone to zone, each barely a few hands broad, all
round the firmament, for her to see whether there was too much here or too
little there. Do not some ladies require three hours to attire them- selves for
a Ball, and that when four hands are at work, and with a mirror in which, as
they step in front of it, they can survey the whole sky? No, that would not do;
so much patience cannot be asked of bailiffs, and could hardly be expected, if
it were asked. For we cannot help observing in the hand of one of them in the
third Plate the very instrument which the man here, whom we have just
designated as the brewery-scullion, is also holding. Wherever that appears, it
is never as an emblem of patience. I believe it is called a cowhide whip. Thus
I can see only two ways of solving this puzzle. Either this is not the first
arrest, one that ended perhaps merely with a private castigation, which however
had no effect. I should be very sorry if that were so; and so we come to the
second (and surely the fairest) interpretation: the girl was taken away covered
only so much as the cool air and the gaze of curious nature-lovers in the
street made necessary, and had her wardrobe sent after her. Now we know that in
<st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region> nobody
may be sentenced without a hearing, and that in the places where people are
heard, they are also very much seen. It is an important moment for a poor
sinner who relies to some extent upon her pretty face and figure. She knows for
certain that her misdeeds will find an inexorable and incorruptible judge in
the grave individual who sits opposite her under the sword of justice. But she
knows, too, that among the non-professionals around her, her face, her figure,
her hair, and her whole bearing will find many a judge who will not take the
matter so seriously, people who have not sworn an oath to regard a pretty girl
as immediately reprehensible or even distasteful, just because she had been
caught while on duty. If therefore in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
a woman is brought before the Judge, and if in addition to a pretty face she
possesses of good manners at least the form, and of clothes either possesses,
or knows how to procure, the substance, then one can be sure of something worth
seeing. The name of a Mrs Rudd, who in the year 1775 brought the twin brothers
Perreau to the gallows, from which she escaped herself only through that kind
action of hers, is surely immortalized by all the magazines of that
time&#8212;if the magazines themselves are still in existence. Everything she
wore was described and painted ribbon for ribbon and bow for bow. Her
head-gear, which decency itself seemed to have arranged, was analysed, and
painted for the benefit of those who might perhaps have felt the desire to
catch a few Perreaux themselves; greater honour could not have been accorded to
a Madame Siddons as Cordelia or Desdemona. That was going rather far. But who
would reproach a girl like this if she rakes together her all (which is so
little) against the day of reckoning? The jury are of course forbidden to let
themselves be dazzled by it, but the poor sinner is not forbidden to believe in
the possibility. Even if the blow itself could not be averted thereby, still it
might awaken some Samaritan or other among the spectators who would afterwards
pour oil into the wound; for in London there are some queer Samaritans, and
among them, no doubt, somebody upon whom such a creature with its heavy
mule-trappings would make just as great an impression as did the dancing Grace,
Julie Potocki, upon a certain man of the world, and one of the finest
sentiment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Molly
was found guilty at the Bar and sentenced to be privately whipped, and also to
serve a term of hard labour, beating hemp. And it is of course a slight
intensification of the punishment to make her start in that attire. When she
has run the gauntlet of her fellow-prisoners' tongues, she will make herself
more comfortable. Already, over there on the wall, hang a crinoline and a
braided hat which are no part of the prison livery. How dull her eyes have
grown! The dark rings around them are very noticeable, even in an engraving.
Her mouth, how helplessly agape, and her whole face, how puffy! What a few
false steps in the world can do, if they are the kind that lead to the medicine
bottle! How heavy her poor heart must be! And how awkwardly she holds the
hammer! With the left hand high up and the right a long way down. This is not
the way to beat, at least not hemp&#8212;nor sugar either. Alas! it is a
hopeless task for her, she cannot bear to look at it, she cannot and cannot
beat. But 'thou shalt and must' is written on that face of bronze beside her,
in letters which without punctuation can be read and understood the whole world
over. It was quite unnecessary to stress the words by an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>accent grave!</i> I mean the oblique cowhide is quite redundant&#8212;the
face speaks for itself. Is he not a rogue of a warder, as if designed by Nature
for such a herd? Just like Daphnis in Vergil, </p>
